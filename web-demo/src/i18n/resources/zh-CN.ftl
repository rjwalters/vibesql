# TPC-H specific
bench-tpch-name = TPC-H
bench-tpch-title = TPC-H Decision Support Benchmark
bench-tpch-description = These benchmarks use the industry-standard <strong>TPC-H benchmark suite</strong>, which simulates real-world decision support workloads with complex analytical queries involving aggregations, joins, subqueries, and sorting.
bench-tpch-ops-label = TPC-H queries
bench-tpch-note-intro = All benchmarks measure end-to-end query execution time including parsing, planning, execution, and result materialization. This represents <strong>real-world SQL engine performance</strong> for analytical workloads.
bench-tpch-note-queries = <strong>Note:</strong> TPC-H queries test different aspects of SQL performance: simple aggregations (Q1, Q6), complex joins (Q2-Q5, Q7-Q10), subqueries (Q11-Q15), and advanced analytics (Q16-Q22). Hover over query names in the table above for descriptions.

# TPC-H Discussion
bench-tpch-disc-excels-title = Where VibeSQL Excels
bench-tpch-disc-excels = VibeSQL shows strong performance on <strong>scan-heavy aggregation queries</strong> (Q1, Q6, Q14, Q15, Q20) where our columnar execution engine and SIMD-accelerated aggregations shine. These queries involve filtering large tables and computing aggregates without complex join patterns.
bench-tpch-disc-targets-title = Current Optimization Targets
bench-tpch-disc-targets = Multi-way join queries (Q3, Q5, Q7-Q10, Q18, Q19, Q21) currently show SQLite ahead. The primary bottleneck is our hash join implementation, which doesn't yet employ the same level of optimization as SQLite's decades-refined B-tree joins. Specific areas under active development:
bench-tpch-disc-join-ordering = Improved cardinality estimation for better join order selection
bench-tpch-disc-hash-sizing = Adaptive hash table growth and spill-to-disk for large joins
bench-tpch-disc-vectorized = Batch processing in the join inner loop to improve cache utilization
bench-tpch-disc-inl-joins = Leveraging B-tree indexes when beneficial
bench-tpch-disc-path-title = Path to Leadership
bench-tpch-disc-path = VibeSQL's architecture is designed for modern hardware with features like columnar storage, vectorized execution, and lock-free concurrency. As these optimizations mature, we expect VibeSQL to achieve consistent leadership across all TPC-H queries. The fundamental design supports parallelism and SIMD that traditional row-store databases cannot easily retrofit.

# TPC-DS specific
bench-tpcds-name = TPC-DS
bench-tpcds-title = TPC-DS Decision Support Benchmark
bench-tpcds-description = <strong>TPC-DS</strong> is the successor to TPC-H, featuring 99 queries that model a modern decision support system with significantly more complex query patterns including multiple fact tables, snow-flake schema, and advanced SQL features.
bench-tpcds-ops-label = TPC-DS queries
bench-tpcds-note-intro = TPC-DS queries are substantially more complex than TPC-H, testing advanced SQL features like window functions, common table expressions (WITH clause), and complex join patterns across multiple fact and dimension tables.
bench-tpcds-note-remaining = <strong>Note:</strong> Remaining unsupported queries require features like INTERSECT/EXCEPT or specific date arithmetic functions not yet implemented.

# TPC-DS Discussion
bench-tpcds-disc-coverage-title = SQL:1999 Feature Coverage
bench-tpcds-disc-coverage = TPC-DS exercises the most demanding SQL features. VibeSQL passes <strong>88 of 99 queries</strong>, demonstrating broad coverage of SQL:1999 including ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING(), window functions with complex framing, and recursive CTEs. The remaining queries require INTERSECT/EXCEPT set operations.
bench-tpcds-disc-optimization-title = Complex Query Optimization
bench-tpcds-disc-optimization = TPC-DS queries often join 10+ tables with correlated subqueries. Current focus areas:
bench-tpcds-disc-cte = Intelligent decision between materialized and inline CTEs
bench-tpcds-disc-decorrelation = Converting correlated subqueries to joins when beneficial
bench-tpcds-disc-star = Fact-dimension join ordering for analytical patterns
bench-tpcds-disc-toward-title = Toward 99/99
bench-tpcds-disc-toward = INTERSECT and EXCEPT are planned additions that will enable the remaining queries. These set operations fit naturally into our existing query algebra and will be implemented as hash-based operators similar to our DISTINCT processing.

# TPC-C specific

bench-tpcc-disc-faster = VibeSQL achieves <strong>~79,000 transactions per second</strong> compared to SQLite's ~1,900 TPS, a 42x improvement. This dramatic speedup comes from our lock-free MVCC architecture that avoids SQLite's coarse-grained locking on every write operation.
bench-tpcc-disc-dominates-title = Why VibeSQL Dominates OLTP
bench-tpcc-disc-lockfree = MVCC allows readers and writers to proceed concurrently without blocking
bench-tpcc-disc-optimistic = Transactions only conflict at commit time, not during execution
bench-tpcc-disc-btree = Purpose-built index structure optimized for in-memory workloads
bench-tpcc-disc-prepared = Query plans are compiled once and reused
bench-tpcc-disc-scaling-title = Scaling Further
bench-tpcc-disc-scaling = Current results are single-threaded. VibeSQL's architecture supports multi-threaded transaction processing, and we expect near-linear scaling as we add parallel execution support. Our goal is to achieve 500K+ TPS on modern multi-core hardware.

# Sysbench Embedded specific
bench-sysbench-embedded-name = Sysbench (Embedded)
bench-sysbench-embedded-title = Sysbench Micro-Benchmarks (Embedded)
bench-sysbench-embedded-description = <strong>Sysbench</strong> provides focused micro-benchmarks that isolate specific database operations. These tests measure raw performance for fundamental operations without the complexity of full transaction workloads.
bench-sysbench-embedded-ops-label = Sysbench operations
bench-sysbench-embedded-note = Embedded mode runs the database in-process with zero network overhead, ideal for single-process applications where minimal latency is critical.

# Sysbench Operation Descriptions
bench-sysbench-point-select = Point Select - Single row lookup by primary key
bench-sysbench-insert = Insert - Insert new rows into table
bench-sysbench-update-index = Update Index - Update indexed column (k = k + 1)
bench-sysbench-update-non-index = Update Non-Index - Update non-indexed column
bench-sysbench-delete = Delete - Remove rows by primary key
bench-sysbench-range-queries = Range Queries - Simple, SUM, ORDER BY, and DISTINCT range scans

# Sysbench Embedded Discussion
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-point-title = Point Lookups: VibeSQL Leads
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-point = VibeSQL's direct API achieves <strong>~137ns per point select</strong>, matching SQLite and vastly outperforming DuckDB (~140µs). Our B-tree implementation is optimized for single-row lookups with minimal pointer chasing and cache-friendly node layouts.
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-index-title = Index Updates: 2x Faster
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-index = VibeSQL's indexed updates run at <strong>~740ns vs SQLite's ~1.6µs</strong>. Our MVCC design allows in-place index updates without write-ahead logging overhead for each operation.
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-improve-title = Areas for Improvement
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-bulk = SQLite's batch insert path is highly optimized; we're adding batched B-tree operations
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-nonindex = Full table scans for non-indexed columns need predicate pushdown optimization
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-deletes = Our tombstone-based deletion has cleanup overhead; compaction improvements are planned
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-duckdb-title = DuckDB Comparison
bench-sysbench-emb-disc-duckdb = DuckDB is optimized for analytical workloads, not micro-operations. Its 100-1000x slower results here reflect architectural choices (columnar storage, vectorized execution) that trade single-row latency for bulk throughput. VibeSQL targets both use cases.

# Footprint Embedded Discussion
bench-footprint-emb-disc-size-title = Binary Size: Middle Ground
bench-footprint-emb-disc-size = VibeSQL at <strong>~17MB</strong> sits between SQLite (~5MB) and DuckDB (~45MB). This reflects our choice to include advanced features (window functions, CTEs, columnar execution) while keeping the binary manageable for embedded deployments.
bench-footprint-emb-disc-startup-title = Startup: Fastest Cold Start
bench-footprint-emb-disc-startup = VibeSQL achieves <strong>~7.7ms cold startup</strong>, slightly faster than SQLite (~8.2ms) and significantly faster than DuckDB (~14.6ms). Our minimal initialization path loads only essential metadata structures on startup.
bench-footprint-emb-disc-memory-title = Memory Efficiency
