# /repo:deps — Third-Party Dependency Currency

Keep the repo's **third-party dependencies** current: npm / pip / cargo / Go
packages and GitHub Actions. Two halves, usually run together:

1. **Install / verify Dependabot** — the config file *and* the repo-level
   security-updates flag, which are two independent things.
2. **Triage open Dependabot PRs** — what each one is, whether it's risky, and
   whether to take it.

This is the companion to [[update-tools]], not a part of it. `update-tools`
compares *installer-managed tool packages* (Loom, Anvil, Repo Skills) against a
local source clone; there is no source clone to diff for Dependabot, and
"triage incoming bot PRs" is a different activity from "update an installed
package." Keeping them separate keeps `update-tools`' comparison model intact.

Everything here either writes repo config, flips a repository setting, or
merges a PR — so like `release`, `remote`, `followups`, and `update-tools`,
this command **always confirms first** and never auto-applies. `--check` is the
report-only form.

## Usage

```
/repo:deps                  # Report status + open Dependabot PRs, then offer actions
/repo:deps --check          # Report only — never writes, never merges
/repo:deps --install        # Only the install/verify half (config + security flag)
/repo:deps --review         # Only the PR-triage half
/repo:deps --review 123     # Triage one PR in depth
```

## Prerequisites

Dependabot is a GitHub feature. Confirm the repo is on GitHub before doing
anything else — if `origin` points at Gitea or another forge, say so and stop
rather than scaffolding config that will never run:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url    # → derive OWNER/REPO; must be a GitHub host
gh auth status
```

## Steps — install / verify

### 1. Report config and the security flag as two distinct items

Writing `.github/dependabot.yml` enables **version** updates only. Dependabot
**security** updates are a repository setting that is entirely independent — a
repo can have a perfectly good config file and still have CVE alerting off.
Check and report both:

```bash
git ls-files '.github/dependabot.yml' '.github/dependabot.yaml'   # version updates

# Security updates — a dedicated endpoint, NOT a security_and_analysis key:
# returns a definitive {"enabled": bool}; 403 → needs admin (see UNKNOWN note below)
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/automated-security-fixes --jq '.enabled'

# Alerts — likewise a dedicated endpoint, NOT a security_and_analysis key:
#   204 → enabled, 404 → disabled
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/vulnerability-alerts -i 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

Read both flags from their dedicated endpoints, never from `security_and_analysis`.
That object is an unreliable source for either one, for two different reasons:

- `security_and_analysis.dependabot_alerts` is simply **absent** on many repos
  even when the object is otherwise fully populated, so a `// "UNKNOWN"`
  fallback on it reports "can't tell" for a repo you can read perfectly well.
  (Verified against `rjwalters/repo`: `security_and_analysis` returns
  `dependabot_security_updates` and the `secret_scanning*` keys with no
  `dependabot_alerts` among them.)
- On a **private repo without GitHub Advanced Security**, GitHub omits the
  **whole `security_and_analysis` object** regardless of token permissions —
  even a token with full admin sees it absent. So "object absent" and "no
  permission to see it" are different states, and only `automated-security-fixes`
  returning `403` is evidence of the latter; treating an absent
  `security_and_analysis` object itself as proof of missing admin is not
  reliable and misreports a plan/visibility limitation as a permission gap.

Report them on separate rows, never collapsed into one "Dependabot: on":

```
DEPENDABOT
==========
| Item                            | Status                                  |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| .github/dependabot.yml          | absent — no version updates configured  |
| vulnerability alerts (repo flag)| disabled (404)                          |
| security updates (repo flag)    | disabled — no automatic CVE fix PRs     |
| Open Dependabot PRs             | 0                                       |
```

Reserve **UNKNOWN (needs admin)** for an actual permission failure — a `403`
from `/automated-security-fixes` (security updates) or `/vulnerability-alerts`
(alerts). Do **not** report a flag as `disabled` when the endpoint returned
`403`; "can't see it" and "it's off" are different answers and only one of
them justifies a write. Conversely, do **not** infer UNKNOWN from an absent
`security_and_analysis` object — as noted above, private repos without GitHub
Advanced Security omit that object even for a fully-admin token, so its
absence alone proves nothing about permissions; the dedicated endpoints are
the authoritative source either way.

### 2. Detect the ecosystems actually present

Scaffold from what the repo really contains, never from a fixed template. Look
for manifests at the root **and** in subdirectories (each distinct directory
needs its own `updates:` entry with the right `directory:` value):

| Ecosystem | Detect via |
|---|---|
| `github-actions` | `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.github/actions/*/action.yml` |
| `npm` | `package.json` (`pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json`) |
| `cargo` | `Cargo.toml` |
| `pip` | `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile` |
| `gomod` | `go.mod` |
| `bundler` | `Gemfile` |
| `composer` | `composer.json` |
| `docker` | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` |
| `gitsubmodule` | `.gitmodules` |

```bash
git ls-files '.github/workflows/*' '.github/actions/*' \
  '*package.json' '*Cargo.toml' '*go.mod' '*requirements*.txt' '*pyproject.toml' \
  '*Pipfile' '*Gemfile' '*composer.json' '.gitmodules' '*Dockerfile' \
  '*docker-compose.yml'
```

Use `git ls-files` for **every** probe — including the workflow directory — not
`ls` with a glob. Two reasons: vendored and ignored trees can't produce phantom
ecosystems, and under `zsh` an unmatched glob like `ls .github/workflows/*.yaml`
is a **hard error that aborts the whole command line**, so a repo with `.yml`
workflows can end up reporting no Actions ecosystem at all. `2>/dev/null` does
not save you — zsh fails before `ls` ever runs.

If **nothing** is detected, say there is nothing to scaffold and stop — do not
guess an ecosystem the repo doesn't have.

#### 2a. Classify each manifest as repo-owned or installer-owned

Presence alone is not ownership. A manifest that lives under a tool root
installed by Loom/Anvil/Repo-Skills-style installers is *vendored,
installer-owned* code — the next tool install/upgrade overwrites it, so a
Dependabot PR against it is churn, not value. This is the same signal
[[update-tools]] step 1 already sweeps for — use the same bounded `find`, not a
fixed path list, so a future tool family member is picked up without a doc
edit here too:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 4 -name "install-metadata.json" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" 2>/dev/null
```

Each hit establishes a **tool root** (the directory containing that
`install-metadata.json`, e.g. `.anvil/`, `.loom/`, `.kct/`,
`.claude/skills/repo/`). A manifest from step 2 is **installer-owned** when its
path falls under one of these roots; everything else is **repo-owned**.

Do this classification per manifest, not per ecosystem — an ecosystem can have
both a repo-owned and an installer-owned manifest at once (e.g. a root
`pyproject.toml` alongside `.anvil/pyproject.toml`), and only the latter is
excluded.

Report the two groups separately, and never fold an installer-owned manifest
into the scaffold proposal:

```
MANIFESTS
=========
| Manifest                | Ecosystem | Ownership                                        |
|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| pyproject.toml (root)   | pip       | repo-owned                                       |
| .anvil/pyproject.toml   | pip       | installer-owned (anvil); use /repo:update-tools  |
| .anvil/uv.lock          | pip       | installer-owned (anvil); use /repo:update-tools  |
| package.json (root)     | npm       | repo-owned — but dependency-free (see below)     |
```

A dependency-free manifest is also not scaffoldable: a `package.json` with no
entries in `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, `peerDependencies`, or
`optionalDependencies`, and no lockfile, has nothing for Dependabot to update.
Check it explicitly rather than assuming presence implies content:

```bash
jq '{dependencies, devDependencies, peerDependencies, optionalDependencies}' package.json
```

If every detected manifest for an ecosystem is either installer-owned or
dependency-free, that ecosystem drops out of the scaffold candidate list
entirely — it does not get an `updates:` entry.

If, after this filtering, **no ecosystem remains** — every detected manifest
was installer-owned, dependency-free, or both — do not propose a
`dependabot.yml` at all. Say so explicitly and why, and point installer-owned
findings at `/repo:update-tools` as the remediation path for their
dependencies (that command upgrades the vendored manifest itself; a Dependabot
PR against it would just be reverted by the next install). Still continue to
step 5 for the repo-level security flags — those are useful independent of
whether there is anything to scaffold.

### 3. Validate every label the config would reference — by description

A scaffolded config can attach labels to bot PRs (`labels:` in the `updates:`
entry). Before referencing **any** label, read its description and confirm a
bot may apply it:

```bash
# Labels reserved for a specific party — refuse every one of these, and name
# the party in the report
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.description // "" | test("Applied by:")) | "REFUSE: \(.name) — reserved for \(((.description // "") | capture("Applied by: (?<party>[^.]+)").party // "unknown party") | sub(" only\\s*$"; "")) — \(.description)"'

# Remaining candidates
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/labels --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select((.description // "" | test("Applied by:")) | not) | .name'
```

Two details that matter in that jq: `.description // ""` is **required** — a
label with a null description makes a bare `.description | test(…)` abort with
`null (null) cannot be matched, as it is not a string`, which can drop the rest
of the label list mid-scan and silently shrink the set you validate against.
And prefer `gh api …/labels` over `gh label list --json` — the latter goes
through GraphQL, which shares a separate (and, on a busy agent host, routinely
exhausted) rate-limit bucket from REST.

Rules:

- The label must **exist**. Existence alone is not enough.
- **Refuse any label whose description reserves it for a party** — look for
  the literal substring `Applied by:`, not just `Applied by: humans`. The
  convention reserves labels for parties other than humans too — e.g.
  `loom:evaluating`: *"Champion is evaluating this proposal (claim label,
  stale after 15m). Applied by: Champion only."* is exactly as off-limits to
  Dependabot as a human-reserved label: it is a claim label with staleness
  semantics owned by a specific actor, and Dependabot applying it would feed
  automation that acts on that claim. Having Dependabot apply *any*
  `Applied by:` label violates that label's own contract, regardless of which
  party it names.
- Report which party each refused label is reserved for (e.g. "REFUSE:
  loom:evaluating — reserved for Champion").
- **Never create a label** to solve this. No `gh label create`, ever. If no
  suitable label exists, scaffold the config **without** a `labels:` key and
  say so in the report. This refuse-by-default posture is intentionally
  stricter than necessary — it can pass over a label that a repo owner would
  in fact consider fine for Dependabot to apply (e.g. an `Applied by: <bot>`
  label meant for automation) — but the safe fallback of no `labels:` key
  costs nothing, while silently applying a reserved label can violate its
  contract. If a repo wants a bot-applied label used here, that is a policy
  call for a human to make explicitly, not something this check should infer.
- A maintenance/chore-tier label (e.g. `tier:maintenance`, `dependencies`,
  `chore`) is the usual right answer when one is present and unrestricted.

Report the decision explicitly: which label was chosen, or which were rejected
and why.

### 4. Offer to scaffold the config (confirm first)

Only ecosystems that survived step 2a's filtering — repo-owned manifests with
real dependencies — are candidates here. If step 2a already concluded there is
nothing left to scaffold, skip straight to step 5 rather than proposing a
config anyway.

Grouping policy is **per-ecosystem**, not uniform. Reviewing every Actions bump
individually is noise; batching a breaking change into line 4 of a 12-package
PR is how a risk-bearing dependency slips through unreviewed.

| Ecosystem | Policy | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `github-actions` | group everything, majors included | low-risk, individually reviewing them is noise |
| package ecosystems (`npm`, `cargo`, `pip`, …) | group minor + patch; **majors ungrouped** | a breaking change deserves its own reviewable PR |

**Ask which dependencies are risk-bearing** rather than applying one policy to
everything — deps coupled to an external binary or service (e.g.
`playwright-core` and its browser binary, a database driver, a native
toolchain) should stay ungrouped even at minor/patch, via `exclude-patterns`.

Show the proposed file in full and get approval before writing:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      github-actions:
        patterns: ["*"]
        update-types: ["major", "minor", "patch"]

  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    groups:
      npm-minor-patch:
        patterns: ["*"]
        exclude-patterns: ["playwright-core"]   # risk-bearing → its own PR
        update-types: ["minor", "patch"]
    # majors are deliberately ungrouped: one reviewable PR each
```

Add `labels: ["<validated-label>"]` only if step 3 approved one. Write the file
only on explicit approval; under `--check`, stop here and show it as a proposal.

### 5. Offer to enable the repo-level flags (confirm first)

Independent of the file, and a separate confirmation. Alerts are a
**prerequisite** for automated security fixes — enable in this order:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/OWNER/REPO/vulnerability-alerts       # prerequisite
gh api -X PUT repos/OWNER/REPO/automated-security-fixes
```

Both need admin. On a 403, report that the flag needs a repo admin and move on
— never present a failed write as success. Re-read the flags afterward and show
the before/after.

### 6. Check for PRs immediately after the config lands

**Dependabot fires on config merge, not on schedule.** The first PRs typically
arrive within a couple of minutes of the config landing on the default branch,
regardless of `interval: weekly`. Never tell the user to "expect your first PR
Monday" — wait briefly, then run the PR review half below.

## Steps — review open Dependabot PRs

### 7. List the bot's open PRs

```bash
gh pr list --author "app/dependabot" --state open \
  --json number,title,headRefName,createdAt,statusCheckRollup,labels

# REST fallback when GraphQL's rate-limit bucket is exhausted. Note the author
# spelling differs: gh's --author filter wants "app/dependabot", the REST
# payload carries login "dependabot[bot]". This jq deliberately emits only
# number/title — if a later step starts consuming headRefName/createdAt/
# statusCheckRollup/labels, widen it, or the fallback path silently loses them
# (statusCheckRollup has no REST field: use `gh pr checks <N>` per PR instead).
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login == "dependabot[bot]") | "#\(.number) \(.title)"'
```

If there are none, say so — and if the config was just written, note that PRs
land within minutes rather than on the stated interval.

### 8. Classify each PR

For every PR report: **ecosystem**, **update type** (major vs minor/patch —
majors flagged), **CI status**, **whether it's stale** (the manifest on the
base branch already satisfies it — see the sub-step below), and what actually
changed.

Update type comes from the title/branch (`bump X from 1.2.3 to 2.0.0` →
compare the leading version components) — confirm against the diff rather than
trusting the title alone:

```bash
# REST rather than `gh pr view --json` — same reason as the label lookup above:
# any `--json` flag on `gh pr`/`gh issue` forces a GraphQL query. `gh pr diff`
# and `gh pr checks` take no `--json` and are already REST-backed.
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/<N> --jq '{title, body}'
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/<N>/files --paginate --jq '[.[].filename]'
gh pr diff <N>
gh pr checks <N>
```

#### CI status caveat — green only means what CI actually exercises

**Scaffolding an ecosystem's Dependabot config does not imply the repo's CI
exercises that ecosystem's artifact.** `/repo:deps` scaffolds an ecosystem
purely from manifest presence (Safety Rule 4) — it never checks whether any CI
job builds or runs what that manifest produces. A bot PR's "CI status" is only
as meaningful as what CI does with the changed files: a `npm`/`cargo`/`pip`
bump that CI compiles and tests is well-verified by green; a `docker`-ecosystem
bump (base-image or layer change) is verified by green only if some job
actually runs `docker build`. This generalizes to any ecosystem whose
artifact CI neither builds nor runs — Terraform providers with no `terraform
plan` job, a Helm chart with no `helm template`/lint step, etc.

Before reporting a PR's CI status as reassuring, check whether the repo's
workflows actually build/run that ecosystem's artifact (`grep` the
`.github/workflows/*.yml` for the relevant command — `docker build`,
`terraform plan`, …). If they don't, report the PR's CI as **green but
unverifiable by this repo's checks** rather than plain "green" — e.g. a
`docker`-ecosystem PR when no workflow runs `docker build` against the
Dockerfile it touches. (As of this writing this repo's own `docker` entry —
the root `Dockerfile` — is covered: `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` runs
`docker build .` on any PR/push touching it, `paths:`-filtered off unrelated
PRs — added in response to issue #231, after the first docker Dependabot PR
merged on a green check that had built nothing. Re-check this note against
the workflow files each run rather than trusting this parenthetical, since
either side of it can drift.)

#### Stale check — compare the PR's target against the manifest on the base branch

**Dependabot's open PRs go stale after any bulk-update merge.** Its scan runs
on an interval, so a scan that started before a "update everything" PR landed
will still open PRs proposing versions the merge already declared — or *older*
ones. Counting those as pending upgrade work is a false signal, and it is
exactly the state the repo is in right after someone merges a bulk update and
runs this command to confirm the repo is clean. Before classifying update type,
decide whether each PR is **stale** (already satisfied by the manifest) or
**real** (still forward work):

1. **Identify the manifest(s) the PR touches.** Reuse the
   `pulls/<N>/files` filenames already fetched above — the manifest is the
   ecosystem file among them (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`,
   `requirements*.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`,
   `composer.json`, …), the same set step 2 detects. Dependabot may touch a
   lockfile too; read the **manifest**, since that is where the declared range
   lives.

2. **Read each manifest from the base branch, not the PR head.** The PR head
   necessarily contains the bump, so comparing against it always reports
   "satisfied". Read the base branch instead:

   ```bash
   # <base> is the PR's baseRefName (usually the default branch); <path> is the
   # manifest filename from pulls/<N>/files.
   git show <base>:<path>
   ```

   Extract the currently-declared range for the dependency named in the PR
   title (e.g. `vitest`, `@biomejs/biome`) from that base-branch manifest.

3. **Compare with semver ordering, not string equality.** The PR is satisfied
   by a manifest when the range that manifest already declares permits a
   version **at or above** the PR's proposed target:
   - an exact/`^`/`~` range that already permits the PR's target — `^4.1.10`
     permits a PR proposing `4.1.10` → satisfied;
   - a declared version that is itself **ahead** of the PR's target — `^2.5.7`
     against a PR proposing `2.5.6`, or `^5.20260804.1` against
     `5.20260801.1` → satisfied (the PR is behind). Use semver ordering:
     `2.5.7` > `2.5.6`, so string comparison alone would misread it.

   This is the same leading-component comparison the update-type classification
   already uses for "major vs minor/patch".

4. **Multi-manifest workspaces: stale only if _every_ targeted manifest is at
   or ahead.** A dependency declared in several packages (a monorepo/workspace)
   is stale **only** when every manifest Dependabot's config targets for that
   ecosystem already satisfies the PR's target. If even one manifest still
   declares a range below the PR's version, the PR is **real, pending work** —
   not stale — because that lagging package genuinely needs the bump. (In the
   reported case `vitest` was `^4.1.10` in `tools/pulse` and `tools/xctl` but
   `^4.0.0` in `website`; had the PR targeted `4.1.10`, the `website` package
   would still have needed it — a single satisfied manifest is not enough.)

5. **`github-actions`: each workflow file is its own manifest, and a matching
   title is not enough to call a PR stale.** `github-actions` has no lockfile
   and no package root — a single action name can appear verbatim across N
   unrelated `.github/workflows/*.yml` files that were never conceptually
   "packages," and each one drifts independently. The common source of that
   drift is a **newly added** workflow file: it is authored against whatever
   version was current when someone wrote it, not whatever version the rest
   of the repo already bumped to. Never conclude "stale" from the PR title's
   version pair alone — compare that PR's `pulls/<N>/files` against the pins
   in **every** workflow file that declares the dependency before deciding.

   Concrete case: PR #224 (the grouped `github-actions` PR) bumped
   `actions/checkout` 4 → 7 in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and merged first.
   PR #236 also bumped `actions/checkout` 4 → 7 — but in
   `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`, a workflow file PR #235 had just
   added, still pinned to `actions/checkout@v4`. Despite the identical
   dependency, the identical version pair, and `ci.yml` on the base branch
   already showing `@v7`, #236 was **not** stale: it fixed a workflow file
   #224 never touched. Closing it as a duplicate would have left the new
   Docker-build workflow pinned to a runtime GitHub had already deprecated —
   the same class of deprecation #224 was merged to clear.

**When in doubt, treat the PR as real, not stale.** The two failure modes are
not symmetric: calling a real PR "stale" silently drops a pending upgrade —
it vanishes from the report and never gets applied — while calling a stale PR
"real" only re-merges a no-op, which is harmless. Given that asymmetry,
resolve any ambiguity toward "real."

A PR that is satisfied everywhere it is declared is **stale** — note it as
`stale — already satisfied by manifest`. A stale PR is **excluded from the
majors tally** even when its title/branch names a major-version bump: it
represents no forward change, so it must never be counted as, or described as,
pending upgrade work.

For **GitHub Actions** bumps specifically, check whether the update **clears a
deprecation annotation** — often the actual reason to take a scary-looking
major. Compare annotations on the base branch against the PR head:

```bash
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/$SHA/check-runs" --jq '.check_runs[].id' \
  | while read -r id; do
      gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/check-runs/$id/annotations" --jq '.[].message'
    done
```

Run it for `main`'s head SHA and the PR's head SHA and diff the two sets. A
major bump that removes a *"Node.js 20 is deprecated"* annotation, with CI
green on every matrix leg, is a much easier yes than "a major bump, seems
risky."

The `Note` column carries the `stale — already satisfied by manifest` flag
alongside the existing CI-status/diff notes, so a stale PR is visible as such at
a glance:

```
OPEN DEPENDABOT PRs
===================
| PR  | Ecosystem      | Update                     | Type  | CI    | Note                              |
|-----|----------------|----------------------------|-------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| #12 | github-actions | actions/checkout 4 → 5     | MAJOR | green | clears "Node.js 20 deprecated"    |
| #13 | npm            | 6 packages (minor + patch) | minor | green | grouped                           |
| #14 | npm            | playwright-core 1.4 → 2.0  | MAJOR | red   | browser binary coupling           |
| #15 | npm            | @biomejs/biome 2.5.5 → 2.5.6 | patch | green | stale — already satisfied by manifest (base declares ^2.5.7) |
```

Summarize the split explicitly below the table so callers (including
`/repo:all`) get the counts without re-deriving them —
**open**, **majors** (real forward majors only), and **stale**:

```
4 open, 2 majors, 1 stale — already satisfied by manifest
```

The majors count excludes every stale PR. A PR whose title names a major bump
but whose manifest is already at or ahead (stale) is **not** a major here — it
is counted only in the stale total.

### 9. Offer to merge the safe ones (confirm first)

Propose a merge set and get explicit approval. **Never** merge a major without
its own separate confirmation, and never merge a PR whose CI is red or pending.

In a Loom-managed repo (`.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh` present) use that script
rather than `gh pr merge` — `gh pr merge` attempts a local checkout that fails
when the branch is linked to a worktree:

```bash
./.loom/scripts/merge-pr.sh <N>      # Loom repos
gh pr merge <N> --squash             # otherwise
```

Under `--check`, stop at the report and merge nothing.

## Dependabot PRs are inert to Loom automation by default

State this in the report whenever a `.loom/` directory is present. It is the
natural wrong assumption, and it is safety-relevant:

- Dependabot PRs carry **no `loom:` label**, so `/loom:sweep` Mode C skips them
  ("no actionable label") and Champion will not auto-merge them without
  `loom:pr`.
- That is **safe by default and probably correct** — but it means nothing in
  the Loom pipeline is watching these PRs. They sit open until a human or
  `/repo:deps` triages them.
- Do **not** "fix" this by applying `loom:` labels to bot PRs. Routing bot PRs
  into an auto-merge pipeline is a policy decision for the repo's owner, not a
  side effect of a hygiene command — and any label used for it still has to
  pass the step 3 description check.

## Safety Rules

1. **Never write without confirmation** — the config file, the repo-level
   flags, and each merge are three separate approvals, not one.
2. **Config and security flag are reported independently** — a present
   `dependabot.yml` says nothing about whether CVE alerting is on. Report
   UNKNOWN (not `disabled`) when the token can't read the setting.
3. **Never create a label**, and never reference one whose description reserves
   it for any party (`Applied by: <party>` — humans, Champion, a bot, …). No
   suitable label → no `labels:` key.
4. **Scaffold only detected ecosystems** — no fixed template, no guessing. Zero
   detected means nothing to scaffold.
5. **Never scaffold against an installer-owned manifest** — a manifest under a
   tool root that carries `install-metadata.json` (`.anvil/`, `.loom/`,
   `.claude/skills/*/`, …) is vendored code the next tool install/upgrade
   overwrites; propose `/repo:update-tools` for it instead. Also exclude
   dependency-free manifests (no deps in any block, no lockfile) — nothing for
   Dependabot to update. If every detected ecosystem is installer-owned or
   dependency-free, recommend not scaffolding and say why.
6. **Never auto-merge a major** — majors get their own confirmation, always.
   Red or pending CI is never merged.
7. **Never push or merge under `--check`** — report-only means report-only.
