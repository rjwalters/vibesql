# Phase 6: Profiling Results - Critical Discovery

**Date**: 2025-11-20
**Dataset**: TPC-H SF 0.01 (~60K rows)
**Query**: Q6 (simple filter + aggregation)

## Executive Summary

**🚨 MAJOR FINDING: Columnar storage would only optimize 12% of query time**

Profiling reveals:
- Total query time: **28.6ms (median)**
- Row loading: **3.4ms (12%)**
- Processing: **2.8ms (10%)**
- **Unaccounted: ~22ms (78%)**

**Implication**: Before implementing columnar storage, we need to find and fix the missing 22ms.

## Detailed Results

### Run Statistics (10 iterations)

| Metric | Median | Min | Max |
|--------|---------|-----|-----|
| **Total time** | 28.6ms | 26.9ms | 31.9ms |
| **Row loading** | 3.4ms | 2.7ms | 4.0ms |
| **Processing** | 2.8ms | 2.5ms | 3.2ms |
| **Filter eval** | 110µs | 95µs | 140µs |
| **Aggregation** | 26µs | 25µs | 28µs |

### Per-Row Costs

|-----------|----------|------------|
| Row loading | 56ns | 12% |
| Processing | 46ns | 10% |
| Filter | 1.8ns | 0.4% |

├─ Row loading:  3.4ms (12%)  ← Columnar storage would optimize this
├─ Processing:   2.8ms (10%)
│  ├─ Filter:     110µs (0.4%)
│  └─ Compute:     26µs (0.1%)

## Critical Analysis

### What We Expected

Based on the hypothesis that deseriializtion was the bottleneck:
- Row loading: ~2ms (80%)
- Processing: ~500µs (20%)

### What We Found

- Row loading: 3.4ms (12%) - **Not the bottleneck!**
- Processing: 2.8ms (10%) - Fast
- **Unknown overhead: ~22ms (78%) - The actual bottleneck**

### Where is the Missing 22ms?

Our instrumentation measured:
1. ✅ `execute_from()` - row loading from storage
2. ✅ `execute_unsafe()` - filter + aggregation

But the total execution path includes:
- ❓ SQL parsing (`Parser::parse_sql()`)
- ❓ Executor initialization (`SelectExecutor::new()`)
- ❓ `execute()` method overhead
- ❓ `try_monomorphic_execution()` overhead (before our timing starts)
- ❓ Pattern matching for Q6 plan
- ❓ Result row creation/boxing
- ❓ Unknown allocations

**Hypothesis**: The benchmark includes parsing and executor setup in the timing loop.

---

## Implications for Phase 6

### Original Plan (Based on Wrong Assumption)
- Implement columnar storage
- Eliminate deserialization (expect ~2ms savings)
- Get close to 180µs target

### Reality (Based on Profiling Data)
- Columnar storage saves at most 3.4ms (12%)
- Would still have ~25ms remaining
- **Cannot reach 180µs target with storage alone**

### New Understanding

**Current bottleneck ordering:**
1. **Unknown overhead** (~22ms, 78%) ← FIND THIS FIRST
2. Row loading (3.4ms, 12%)
3. Processing (2.8ms, 10%)

**Optimization priority:**
1. **Investigate and eliminate the 22ms overhead**
2. Then consider columnar storage (saves 3.4ms)
3. Then optimize processing further (saves 2.8ms)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Find the Missing 22ms

**Option A: Add more instrumentation**
```rust
// In benchmark, time each phase separately
let parse_start = Instant::now();
let stmt = Parser::parse_sql(Q6_SQL)?;
let parse_time = parse_start.elapsed();

let exec_create_start = Instant::now();
let executor = SelectExecutor::new(&db);
let exec_create_time = exec_create_start.elapsed();

let exec_start = Instant::now();
let result = executor.execute(&stmt)?;
let exec_time = exec_start.elapsed();
```

**Option B: Move timing outside execute()**
- Current benchmark times the full `execute()` call
- Our instrumentation is inside `try_monomorphic_execution()`
- There's overhead between them

**Option C: Use flamegraph/profiler**
```bash
cargo flamegraph --bench q6_profiling --features "benchmark-comparison,profile-q6"
```

### After Finding the 22ms

**If it's executor overhead:**
- Optimize executor initialization
- Reduce allocations
- Cache schema/metadata

**If it's parsing:**
- Cache parsed queries
- Or accept that benchmarks should parse once, execute many times

**If it's result creation:**
- Optimize Row boxing
- Use arena allocators
- Lazy result materialization

### Only Then: Columnar Storage

Once we've eliminated most of the 22ms overhead, THEN evaluate:
- Would columnar storage help with remaining time?
- What's the new bottleneck split?
- Is 180µs target achievable?

---

## Revised Recommendations

### Don't Implement Columnar Storage Yet

**Reasons:**
1. Only optimizes 12% of current time
2. 78% is unaccounted overhead we haven't investigated
3. Wasting 4 months on wrong optimization
4. Need to understand the system better first

### Do This Instead

**Phase 6a: Find and Fix the 22ms** (1-2 weeks)
1. Add instrumentation to benchmark (separate parse/exec/etc.)
2. Use flamegraph to visualize where time is spent
3. Optimize the actual bottleneck
4. Target: Get total time down to < 10ms

**Phase 6b: Re-evaluate Storage** (after 6a)
- If row loading becomes >50% after fixing overhead, consider columnar
- If still <30%, focus on other optimizations
- Data-driven decision based on new profile

### Alternative Optimizations to Consider

**If the 22ms is unfixable overhead:**
- SIMD vectorization on row processing
- JIT compilation of predicates
- Batch/pipeline execution
- Multi-query optimization

**If row loading is real bottleneck after fixing overhead:**
- Then implement columnar storage
- Custom Rust format preferred (lower overhead than Arrow)
- Zero-copy mmap as designed

## Comparison to Expected Performance

### Current Breakdown
| Component | Time | % | Target |
|-----------|------|---|--------|
| Unknown overhead | 22ms | 78% | ??? |
| Row loading | 3.4ms | 12% | < 100µs with columnar |
| Processing | 2.8ms | 10% | < 500µs with SIMD |

### To Hit 180µs Target

Need to eliminate:
- 22ms overhead → ??? (find it first!)
- 3.4ms loading → ~100µs (34x improvement)
- 2.8ms processing → ~80µs (35x improvement)

**This requires multiple optimization phases, not just columnar storage.**

---

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ Profiling First Was Correct

- Avoided 4-month project that would only help 12%
- Found the real bottleneck (22ms overhead)
- Can now optimize the right thing

### ❌ Issue #2224 Hypothesis Was Wrong

- Assumed deserialization was 80% of time
- Actually only 12% of time
- Shows importance of measuring vs assuming

### 🎯 Next Phase Should Be

**Phase 6 Revised: "Find and eliminate overhead" (not columnar storage yet)**

---

## Technical Details

### Profiling Method

Added `profile-q6` feature with instrumentation:

**Row loading timing** (`execute.rs:251`):
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "profile-q6")]
let load_start = Instant::now();

let mut from_result = self.execute_from(from_clause, cte_results)?;

#[cfg(feature = "profile-q6")]
eprintln!("[Q6 PROFILE] Row loading: {:?} ...", load_start.elapsed());
```

**Processing timing** (`tpch.rs:76`):
```rust
unsafe fn execute_unsafe(&self, rows: &[Row]) -> f64 {
    #[cfg(feature = "profile-q6")]
    let start = Instant::now();

    // ... filter and aggregate ...

    #[cfg(feature = "profile-q6")]
    eprintln!("[Q6 PROFILE] Processing: {:?} ...", start.elapsed());
}
```

### Measurement Accuracy

- Release build (`--release`)
- 10 iterations after 1 warm-up
- Median used (resistant to outliers)
- Sub-microsecond timer resolution

### Potential Measurement Issues

**Could timing overhead affect results?**
- Unlikely: `Instant::now()` is ~20ns
- We measured ~22ms missing, not 22µs
- 1000x larger than measurement overhead

**Could compiler optimize away our code?**
- No: Using `black_box()` equivalent (eprintln!)
- Results match expected values
- Filters working correctly (6K matches from 60K rows)

## Recommendations for Issue #2224

### Update Issue Status

Current issue says:
> "Research and design a columnar storage format... to achieve DuckDB-level performance"

Should be revised to:
> "Find and eliminate 22ms overhead before considering columnar storage"

### New Action Items

1. ✅ Profile current implementation (DONE)
2. ⏳ Find where 22ms overhead is spent (NEW)
3. ⏳ Optimize the actual bottleneck (NEW)
4. ⏳ Re-profile after optimizations (NEW)
5. ⏳ Re-evaluate columnar storage if still needed (DEFERRED)

### Timeline Revision

- Original: 4 months for columnar storage
- Revised:
  - 1-2 weeks: Find 22ms overhead
  - 2-4 weeks: Optimize bottleneck
  - 1 week: Re-evaluate next steps
  - TBD: Columnar storage if still beneficial

---

## Conclusion

**The profiling successfully answered our research question:**

> "Where is the 2.5ms currently spent?"

**Answer:**
- Not in deserialization (12%)
- Not in processing (10%)
- **In unknown overhead (78%)**

**This is a SUCCESS** - we avoided spending 4 months on an optimization that would only improve 12% of the runtime.

**Next step:** Find and fix the real bottleneck before committing to any storage format changes.
