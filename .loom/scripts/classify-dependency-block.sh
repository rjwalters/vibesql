# classify-dependency-block.sh - Separate a TIMING finding from a MERITS finding
# in Champion's proposal-escalation decision (issue #5664).
#
# THE FAILURE MODE THIS EXISTS FOR
#
# Champion escalates a proposal to `loom:operator-only` once it has been
# evaluated N times (default 2) without being revised
# (champion-issue-promo.md -> "Bounding the silent skip"). That rule is right
# for a proposal rejected on its MERITS: the author has been told what is wrong
# and has not acted, so a human has to decide.
#
# It is wrong for a proposal whose only failing finding is "criterion 2: hard
# dependency on #N, which is still open". That is not a merits finding, it is a
# TIMING finding, and it clears itself the moment #N closes. Escalating on it
# converts a transient state into a permanent one, because the asymmetry is
# total:
#
#   * `loom:operator-only` makes Champion skip the issue on every later pass;
#   * so the only actor that could ever notice "the blocker closed, this is
#     promotable now" is the actor that has been told to ignore it.
#
# The observed incident: one architect pass filed five proposals, three of which
# hard-depended on a fourth. Champion escalated all three for the open
# dependency; the dependency merged MINUTES later; the three sat at
# `loom:operator-only` with a stated reason that had become false and no
# mechanism to re-evaluate them. The repo returned to zero dispatchable work
# while holding three ready-to-run proposals.
#
# This script answers the two questions that fix requires, as one testable unit
# instead of as prose judgement inside the role file:
#
#   --check-defer       "Would this escalation be for a self-clearing open
#                        dependency rather than for the proposal's merits?"
#                        -> DEFER (do not escalate; wait for the blocker)
#   --check-unescalate  "Is this ALREADY-escalated proposal one whose recorded
#                        blocker has since closed?"  -> UNESCALATE (remove
#                        `loom:operator-only` and let it be evaluated again)
#
# Both are deliberately CONSERVATIVE in the same direction: a finding is treated
# as dependency-attributable only when it both names a dependency and cites an
# issue/PR reference. Anything else - any merits criterion, an unreadable
# blocker, a genuine dependency CYCLE (which cannot self-clear and is owned by
# `detect-dependency-cycle.sh`) - falls through to the unchanged escalation
# path. Deferring wrongly costs one more waiting proposal; un-escalating wrongly
# costs a human decision being re-automated, so that side is stricter still.
#
# SUB-ISSUE GRANULARITY (#5664, "recurred after closure"). Both questions above
# are about the WHOLE issue. A proposal can declare a `## Startable Subset` (see
# detect-startable-subset.sh) naming part of its work that does not depend on
# the open blocker(s) at all -- an explicit split point the architect stated so
# a Builder could land the unblocked half first. Discarding that split and
# parking the whole issue is a DIFFERENT bug from the timing/merits one above:
# the work was never blocked, only mis-classified at the wrong granularity. Both
# modes below check for it, ahead of the open-blocker outcome:
#
#   --check-defer       an open blocker + a declared startable subset ->
#                        PROMOTE_SUBSET (promote now, scoped to the subset)
#                        instead of DEFER (wait for the whole issue)
#   --check-unescalate   a still-open blocker + a declared startable subset ->
#                        UNESCALATE (with SUBSET_CARVEOUT: yes) instead of
#                        NO_UNESCALATE/blocker-still-open -- this is what heals
#                        an issue that was ALREADY mis-parked before this fix
#                        landed, without waiting for the blocker to close
#
# Usage:
#   classify-dependency-block.sh --issue <N> [--repo <owner/repo>] [options]
#   classify-dependency-block.sh --issue <N> --check-unescalate [--apply]
#
# Options:
#   --issue <N>            Issue number (required).
#   --repo <nwo>           owner/repo of --issue (default: the current repo's origin).
#   --check-defer          Default mode. Should Champion defer instead of escalating?
#   --check-unescalate     Should an already-escalated proposal be un-escalated?
#   --apply                (--check-unescalate only) actually remove
#                          `loom:operator-only` and post one idempotent comment.
#                          Without it the script is strictly read-only.
#   --findings-file <p>    Read the findings from this file instead of fetching
#                          the relevant Champion comment (used by the role file
#                          when it already holds `$COMMENT_BODY`, and by tests).
#   --skip-cycle-check     Do not run detect-dependency-cycle.sh (only safe when
#                          the caller already ran the cycle gate this pass).
#   --no-cache             Read via plain `gh` instead of the `gh-cached` wrapper.
#   --help,-h              Show this help.
#

#   already-unescalated, apply-failed.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - the special action applies (DEFER / UNESCALATE)
#   1 - it does not apply; the caller proceeds exactly as it did before
#   2 - error (bad arguments, issue unreadable, missing jq)
#   3 - (--check-defer only) REEVALUATE: the findings were dependency-only and
#       every recorded blocker is now CLOSED, so the recorded verdict is stale.
#       Re-run the criteria instead of escalating on a finding that no longer holds.
#   4 - (--check-defer only) PROMOTE_SUBSET: the findings were dependency-only,
#       at least one blocker is still OPEN, but the issue declares a startable
#       subset independent of it (#5664) -- promote scoped to that subset
#       instead of deferring the whole issue.
#
# BOUNDED COST. One cached read of the issue, one cached read per DISTINCT
# referenced blocker (deduplicated), and - only when an open blocker is found -
# one bounded `detect-dependency-cycle.sh` walk that shares the same 30s cache.
# A proposal with no dependency findings costs exactly one read.

# is_dependency_finding <one findings bullet>
#
# True (0) when the bullet is attributable to a DEPENDENCY rather than to the
# proposal's merits. Both halves are required:
#
#   1. a dependency word ("blocked by", "blocker", "depends on", "dependent
#      on", "dependency on"/"dependencies on"/"dependency of"/"dependencies
#      of", "requires", "prerequisite", "waiting on"), and
#   2. an actual issue/PR reference.
#
# (2) is what keeps ordinary English out of the timing bucket: "Requires a
# migration plan" and "no dependency injection seam" are merits findings and
# cite nothing, so they still escalate. A finding that cannot name the thing it
# is waiting for is not a finding that can self-clear.
#
# The bare noun "dependency"/"dependencies" is deliberately EXCLUDED from (1) --
# only "dependenc(y|ies) on|of" (a verb-phrase-shaped usage, e.g. "hard
# dependency on #3") counts. A bare noun matches an English section heading
# just as readily as a real blocker (e.g. a quoted "Dependencies / references"
# heading, or "Dependencies section") with no dependency relationship implied
# at all -- that false positive incorrectly un-escalated #4196 (#6112).
# "dependent on" already covers the adjectival phrasing, so nothing is lost by
# requiring the noun form to be followed by its preposition.

**Champion: Un-escalating — a startable subset was never actually blocked**

This proposal was routed to \`$OPERATOR_ONLY_LABEL\` for a **timing** finding, not a
merits one: its only recurring finding was an open dependency. That dependency
($cleared) is still open, but this issue declares a **startable subset**
independent of it:

$subset

Parking the whole issue on a blocker that only covers part of its work was the
mistake, not the wait itself — un-escalating so the subset above can be
promoted and built now.

Removed \`$OPERATOR_ONLY_LABEL\` (and its \`$OPERATOR_BLOCKED_LABEL\` sub-kind
label, if present); this proposal returns to normal evaluation, scoped to the
startable subset until $cleared closes. Nothing here overrides a human
decision — if this proposal genuinely needs one, re-add the label (or state
the merits finding) and it will not be un-escalated again.
