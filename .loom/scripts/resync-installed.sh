# resync-installed.sh - Refresh installed Loom surfaces from the recorded source (#3777, #4239).
#
# The installed Loom surfaces the harness actually executes/reads are copied from
# the Loom source repo's defaults/ tree at install time. After a `git pull` that
# merges a fix to those files, the INSTALLED copies are NOT automatically updated
# — so a repo can run stale hooks/scripts/roles/docs/commands indefinitely (see
# #3777: the guard-precision trio #3755/#3756/#3757 merged to main, but the
# installed guard-destructive.sh kept its pre-fix behavior until hand-copied).
#
# This is the REMEDIATION half of the drift problem. #3770
# (check-main-freshness.sh) DETECTS the drift with a warning; this script FIXES
# it. The intended flow is: "freshness warning says you're stale -> run resync."
#
# PRECONDITION (#6202): that flow only works when a defaults/ SOURCE tree can
# be resolved (see resolve_defaults() below) — this checkout IS the Loom
# source repo, OR the gitignored `.loom/loom-source-path` sidecar points at a
# local clone of it. Neither holds on a checkout that never ran the Loom
# installer locally (a fresh developer clone, a CI checkout, a machine that
# received the repo rather than installing into it) — the exact population
# most likely to be running stale surfaces, since they never ran the
# installer that would have refreshed them. On that population this script
# fails on first use with "Could not locate a defaults/ source tree to sync
# from"; check-main-freshness.sh now detects the same gap and says so before
# you get here (see its own #6202 note), but if you landed on this file
# directly: clone https://github.com/rjwalters/loom locally, then either
# re-run its installer against this repo or write the sidecar yourself
# (`echo /path/to/local/loom-clone > .loom/loom-source-path`).
#
# It is idempotent (a no-op when already in sync), reports per-file
# updated/created/removed/unchanged/skipped, only ever touches files that
# either exist in the source tree or are explicitly declared retired (see
# "RETIRED PAYLOAD FILES" below) — repo-specific files with no source
# counterpart and no retirement entry are left alone — never clobbers a
# symlinked install target, and supports --dry-run.
#
# Surfaces resynced (#4239 widened this from hooks+scripts to the full pure-copy
# surface map — note the asymmetric source->target mapping):

#
# It also applies one targeted field edit outside the pure-copy model (#4285):
# a root package.json whose "name" is exactly "loom-workspace" (the Loom
# installer's workspace-scaffolding stub, `defaults/package.json`) has its
# decoy "version" field deleted in place if present — this is a `jq
# 'del(.version)'` field edit, NOT a whole-file resync, so a consumer's
# customized "scripts" block in the stub is preserved. A consumer's OWN
# package.json (any other "name") is never touched.
#
# On a successful non-dry-run it also re-stamps loom_version, loom_commit, and a
# last_resync date into .loom/install-metadata.json (requires jq or python3;
# skipped with a warning if neither is present — the file sync still succeeds).
# It also ensures a `merge=ours` driver is wired up for that same file (#4528)
# — a machine-local stamp every host re-writes, guaranteeing merge conflicts
# between hosts otherwise — via a Loom-managed .gitattributes block plus local
# git config (never committed; runs every time so a pre-#4528 install
# self-heals on its next resync).
#
# It also refreshes the marker-delimited Loom-managed `.gitignore` block via the
# daemon's `update-gitignore` subcommand (#4280) — the ephemeral-pattern list is
# single-sourced in loom-daemon, so existing installs converge on newly-ignored
# runtime paths (e.g. .loom/sweep-checkpoint/, .loom/worktrees-local/) at resync
# time. A missing daemon binary is a loud warning, not a silent skip. Any path
# still untracked-and-unignored under .loom/ afterward is reported as an audit
# warning so the pattern list can be extended.
#
# In the loom source repo itself (tracked installed surfaces + a local
# defaults/ tree), a non-dry-run that updates a file leaves the tree dirty
# until that resync output is committed. If the only remaining dirt is resync
# output, the summary block prints the exact `git add … && git commit`
# command to run (#4332) — worth doing, since `main_health_gate.rs`'s
# dirty-tree check treats byte-identical installed-surface dirt as ignorable
# (never a reason to skip the gate) but does not commit on the operator's
# behalf. Running this script here — including at a clean checkout pinned to
# origin/main — is supported and expected, not a bug: `.loom/` in this repo is
# a periodically-resynced snapshot of `defaults/`, not a live mirror, so any
# `defaults/`-only merge that lands after the last "chore: resync installed
# Loom surfaces" commit reintroduces drift that is real, deterministic, and
# bounded only by how long it has been since that last resync commit (#5510).
#
# ATOMIC WRITES + DEFERRED SELF-UPDATE (#4669): every file is installed by
# staging a copy NEXT TO its destination and rename(2)-ing it into place, never
# by truncating and rewriting the destination in place. This matters most for
# THIS script: resync-installed.sh is itself a file under defaults/scripts/, so
# a resync copies it over the very path the running bash process is still
# reading from. The old in-place `cp` let bash resume reading a half-rewritten
# file at a now-meaningless byte offset — the reported `syntax error near
# unexpected token` mid-run, which aborted the run and left dozens of surfaces
# partially refreshed. A rename swaps the directory entry and leaves the
# already-open inode intact, so the running process keeps reading the exact
# bytes it started with. Belt-and-suspenders, the self-copy is also DEFERRED:
# it is applied only after every other surface has settled.
#
# A file that cannot be staged or renamed is counted as a FAILURE: the run
# still finishes the remaining files, then prints an explicit PARTIAL summary
# naming every failed path and exits 1. No file is ever left half-written
# (staging happens off to the side), so re-running after fixing the cause
# completes the refresh — a partial refresh is never silent.
#
# CRASH-DETECTION MARKER (#5980): #4669 above protects individual files from
# being torn mid-write, but it does not protect the RUN as a whole from dying
# outright — e.g. hitting a bug in the OLD installed copy of this script
# (before the fixed copy has been synced in) aborts bash entirely, with an
# arbitrary number of surfaces already refreshed and the rest still stale.
# Before #5980, nothing recorded that a run was ever in progress, so a
# crashed run left the working tree silently half-updated while
# .loom/install-metadata.json kept reporting the OLD loom_version — the
# install looked simply "never updated" rather than "partially updated".
#
# `.loom/.resync-in-progress` (gitignored) closes that gap: it is written with
# the target version BEFORE any surface is touched (non-dry-run only) and
# removed only once the run reaches a full, non-partial success. On EVERY
# invocation (including --dry-run, so it doubles as a zero-side-effect
# detector) a leftover marker from a prior run is reported as a loud WARN
# naming the target version and start time it never finished. No separate
# "resume from where it left off" bookkeeping is needed: the whole script is
# already idempotent (see above), so a fresh restart after a crash converges
# on exactly the state a completed run would have reached — files the crashed
# run already finished are simply re-verified as unchanged, not re-copied.
#
# Not done here (left as a follow-up, #5980): inverting the self-update order
# so the script resyncs ITSELF and re-execs into the fixed copy before
# touching any other surface, which would keep a buggy OLD script off the
# critical path entirely instead of only detecting after the fact that it ran
# into one. The marker is the tractable, low-risk half of the fix; the
# reordering is a larger, riskier restructuring of the self-update deferral
# #4669 established.
#
# EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE (never touched by resync — updated by other mechanisms):
#   .loom/config.json       - operator-owned; needs merge-semantics design
#   CLAUDE.md               - repo-customized at install; needs managed-section markers
#   AGENTS.md               - repo-customized at install; needs managed-section markers
#                             (same as CLAUDE.md; #4479). Its full-guide sibling
#                             .loom/AGENTS.md is regenerated by install scaffolding
#                             from defaults/.loom/AGENTS.md, not by resync — same
#                             posture as .loom/CLAUDE.md, WITH ONE NARROW EXCEPTION
#                             (#5559): resync DOES restamp just the "**Loom
#                             Version**" / "Last updated" header lines in
#                             .loom/CLAUDE.md — a targeted field edit (see
#                             resync_claude_md_version_header() below, which
#                             mirrors the package.json version-stub edit's
#                             pattern), NOT a whole-file resync/regenerate. That
#                             still needs the managed-section-markers design
#                             this comment references; the rest of the file's

#
# WORKTREE RESTRICTION (#4563): the installed .loom/ is ALWAYS resolved against
# the PRIMARY worktree (via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`), so running this
# from a linked worktree — an issue/PR worktree under .loom/worktrees/ — writes
# to the MAIN checkout, not to the worktree you are standing in. A Builder that
# does so contaminates main mid-sweep (the 2026-07-30 incident: four installed
# paths written into main from a wave-2 builder's worktree and quarantined by
# check-main-clean.sh). The script therefore REFUSES to run when its own
# `--show-toplevel` differs from the resolved main-checkout root, and exits 1.
# Installed-copy propagation is the periodic resync commit's job: land the
# defaults/ change, then resync from the main checkout. An operator who really
# does mean "write the main checkout's installed copies from here" can pass
# --allow-worktree (or export LOOM_RESYNC_ALLOW_WORKTREE=1). Running from the
# main checkout itself — including any subdirectory of it — is unaffected.
#
# STAGING MODE (#6106): --allow-worktree (or a bare re-run from the main
# checkout) is unsafe while the fleet is live — the daemon may be dispatching
# sweeps in that same checkout, so writing dozens of installed files there
# mid-sweep risks exactly the contamination this whole restriction exists to
# prevent. --output <dir> is the safe alternative: it creates a disposable,
# DETACHED `git worktree` at HEAD under <dir> (never inside .loom/worktrees/,
# and never touching the primary checkout's own files) and resyncs INTO that
# staging worktree instead of REPO_ROOT — so it can be run from anywhere
# (primary checkout or any linked worktree) at any time, including mid-sweep,
# with zero risk to the live checkout. The staging worktree is a real,
# independent git checkout: once the sync is complete you `cd` into it,
# `git add -A && git commit` (and `git push` / open a PR) from there, then
# `git worktree remove` it. See "OUTPUT-DIR STAGING MODE" further below for
# the full mechanics. --dry-run + --output still creates (and then
# auto-removes) the staging worktree, so a preview never leaves any residue.
#
# Local-override convention: list a relative path (e.g. `hooks/guard-destructive.sh`,
# `scripts/foo.sh`, `roles/custom-role.md`, `docs/notes.md`, `bin/loom`,
# `commands/loom/mine.md`, `package.json` to pin the #4285 stub version edit, or
# `.loom/CLAUDE.md` to pin the #5559 version-header restamp) — one per line — in
# `.loom/resync-ignore` to pin an intentional per-repo customization. Matching
# files are reported as `skipped` and never overwritten. Blank lines and `#`
# comments are ignored.
#
# RETIRED PAYLOAD FILES (#5981): the walk above only ever visits files that
# CURRENTLY exist under defaults/, so a file retired upstream (deleted from
# defaults/ entirely, e.g. defaults/scripts/status.sh in #5710) has no
# source to walk from and is therefore never noticed, let alone removed —
# it survives indefinitely in every already-installed repo. `defaults/.loom-retired.list`
# is the declarative fix: one target-relative path per line (same
# report-relative form as the per-file report and `.loom/resync-ignore`,
# e.g. `scripts/status.sh`), naming a file that WAS Loom payload and has
# since been deleted from defaults/. Every run, `remove_retired_files()`
# removes each listed path that is still present in the installed tree,
# reporting it with the `removed` verb — honoring the same `.loom/resync-ignore`
# pin and destination-symlink guard the update path uses, so a consumer who
# deliberately kept a fork of a retired file is never touched. A file with
# no retirement entry and no source counterpart is untouched, exactly as
# before — this is additive, not a general directory diff, so it can never
# guess-delete an unrelated repo-specific file.
#
# OUTPUT-DIR STAGING MODE (#6106): --output <dir> resyncs into an isolated
# location instead of the primary checkout, so a COMPLETE resync can be
# generated on demand — including while the fleet is live and mid-sweep —
# without the "run it from the main checkout" remedy the #4563 refusal above
# normally prescribes (which is unsafe precisely when the daemon is actively
# dispatching sweeps there). Mechanics:
#   1. <dir> must not already exist. It is created via
#      `git worktree add --detach <dir> HEAD` against the PRIMARY checkout's
#      repository — a real, independent git checkout at the primary's current
#      HEAD, registered as a linked worktree but living wherever the caller
#      pointed <dir> (never inside .loom/worktrees/, so it can never collide
#      with worktree.sh's bookkeeping). Creating it only touches git's
#      worktree-registry metadata (.git/worktrees/) — it does not read, write,
#      or lock any file in the primary checkout's own working tree.
#   2. Every destination this script would otherwise resolve under the
#      primary checkout (.loom/hooks, .loom/scripts, .loom/roles, .loom/docs,
#      .loom/runtimes, .loom/bin, .claude/commands/loom, the single-file docs,
#      install-metadata.json, .loom/CLAUDE.md, package.json, .gitattributes,
#      .gitignore) is instead resolved under <dir>. defaults/ itself (the
#      SOURCE of the sync) is still read from the primary checkout — that is
#      a read, never a write, so it carries none of the #4563 hazard.
#   3. On success the run prints the exact `cd <dir> && git add -A && git
#      commit ... && git push` sequence to turn the staged tree into a
#      resync commit (and PR) from a location that was never live-mid-sweep,
#      plus the `git worktree remove` to clean up afterward.
# Because step 1 creates a real worktree, the #4563 linked-worktree refusal
# itself never applies when --output is given — there is nothing left for it
# to protect, since nothing is written to the primary checkout either way.
# --dry-run + --output still creates the staging worktree (needed as the
# preview's target) but auto-removes it before exiting, since a preview must
# leave no residue.
#
# The SAME `.loom/resync-ignore` list is read by the installer (issue #5971) as
# a declaration that a path inside `.loom/` is repo-owned: the reinstall clean
# sweep in `loom-daemon init` and `uninstall-loom.sh --clean` will not delete
# it. One list, one meaning — "this path is the repo's, not Loom's". Full
# ownership rule: `.loom/docs/repo-owned-files.md`.

#   - report_prefix   : prepended to the relative path for per-file reporting AND

#                       "bin", "commands/loom").

#   lstats each entry and a symlink never matches `-type f`, so those 17
#   files silently fell out of the walk entirely -- not updated, not
#   skipped, not counted -- and a consumer repo's installed .loom/roles/*.md
#   (real file copies there, not symlinks) went stale forever while resync
#   reported success. `find -L` dereferences before the type test, so a
#   symlinked source is walked as the regular file it resolves to; `cp`
#   (sync_one) and `cmp` both already dereference by default, so the
#   destination gets the RESOLVED CONTENT, never a copied link. This is a

#   .loom/roles/*.md and .loom/docs/*.md, which are themselves symlinks back

#
# When the canonical generic guard is installed in this repo AND passes ALL
# FOUR runtime probes the guard-destructive.sh dispatcher requires — the
# rjwalters/repo#29 VERSION marker, the `worktree-write-confinement`
# CAPABILITY marker (proving it actually implements the Loom-only Bash-tool
# write-confinement category, issue #4178, not just the unrelated repo#29 fix),
# the `--comment|--search` / `--arg|--argjson` CAPABILITY markers (proving
# it actually masks `gh --search`/`jq --arg`/`--argjson` quoted values before
# the catastrophic/ask scans, issue #5916, not just the unrelated
# version/write-confinement fixes), and the `gh-comment-body-literal-at`
# CAPABILITY marker (proving it actually carries the `--body @path`
# literal-string hard deny, issue #4523/#5974, not just the unrelated
# version/write-confinement/search-mask fixes) — Loom's vendored generic guard
# (guard-destructive-generic.sh) is intentionally NOT installed — the
# guard-destructive.sh dispatcher defers to the canonical guard at runtime.
# Resync must therefore neither resurrect the vendored copy nor leave a stale
# one behind. Same four-probe check the dispatcher/installer use, so all
# four agree on which guard wins (#4894: requiring only the version probe
# here would strip the vendored fallback out from under the dispatcher the
# moment a canonical guard picked up repo#29 without write-confinement,
# leaving zero coverage instead of the intended fallback; #5916 closes the
# same class of gap for the search/jq masking capability; #5974 closes it
# again for the --body @path hard-deny capability — see
# defaults/hooks/guard-destructive.sh's header comment for why a single
# `gh-comment-body-literal-at` marker is an adequate proxy for that whole
# rule family rather than a probe per decision-tag).
#
# Guard against #4403: the canonical Repo Skills guard is a LOCAL, typically
# gitignored, per-host install (`.claude/skills/repo/`), but the vendored guard
# it defers to (`.loom/hooks/guard-destructive-generic.sh`) can be git-tracked in
# a repo that commits `.loom/` (this repo dogfoods that layout). Removing a
# tracked file based purely on one contributor's local skill install deletes a
# repo-shared file for everyone else. So below, before removing the vendored
# guard, we check whether the target is git-tracked and skip the removal if so —
# only untracked (the normal consumer-repo) targets are removed.
#
# #4566: that skip is reported as an informational `note`, NOT a `warn`. The
# condition is a *steady state*, not an anomaly: it can only arise where a
# maintainer deliberately committed the vendored fallback (posture (a) — keep the
# tracked copy so contributors/CI without Repo Skills still get full generic-guard
# coverage; see defaults/docs/guard-hooks.md). Resync already takes the only
# correct action automatically, every run, forever — so an alarm-level line that
# reprints on every resync with no way to acknowledge it is pure noise. A repo
# that genuinely wants posture (b) drops the vendored copy deliberately with
# `git rm .loom/hooks/guard-destructive-generic.sh`, after which this branch stops
# firing entirely.

# above) — as opposed to a repo-specific file with no source counterpart,
# which the walks above already leave untouched by construction.

# this point writes a payload file. Clear the marker HERE, before
# refresh_gitignore_block()/audit_untracked_loom_paths() run, rather than
# waiting for the very end of the script: those two read the CURRENT
# untracked-and-unignored state of .loom/, and the marker itself is
# untracked-and-unignored by construction until a consumer's installed
# .gitignore has caught up to this fix — leaving it in place through the
# audit would make a routine, fully successful run spuriously warn about its
# own transient control file. A PARTIAL refresh (N_FAILED > 0) intentionally
# skips this — the marker must survive so the crash/partial state stays
# detectable, exactly as the final summary block does at the bottom of the

# targeted field deletion instead: strip ".version" from the root package.json
# ONLY when ".name" is exactly "loom-workspace" and a "version" field is
# present. A consumer's own package.json (any other name) is left untouched.

# ---------- targeted field edit: .loom/CLAUDE.md version header (#5559) ----------
#
# .loom/CLAUDE.md is the full vendored guide, generated ONCE from
# defaults/.loom/CLAUDE.md's {{LOOM_VERSION}}/{{INSTALL_DATE}} template by
# install-time scaffolding (`loom-daemon init`) — not by this script (see the
# "EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE" header comment above). Because resync never
# touches it, but DOES keep .loom/install-metadata.json's loom_version current
# every run (restamp_metadata() below), the two stamps silently drift apart:
# install-metadata.json always reports the freshly-resynced version while the
# guide's own "**Loom Version**" header keeps showing whatever version was
# installed originally. scripts/install-loom.sh's idempotency check prefers
# install-metadata.json, so it never notices the stale header (#5559).
#
# Rather than regenerating the whole file (which would need the
# managed-section-markers design the OUT OF SCOPE comment references, and
# .loom/CLAUDE.md is not otherwise repo-customized so a full regenerate is
# arguably safe but out of this fix's scope), this does a targeted field edit
# of just the "**Loom Version**" and "Last updated" lines — mirroring the
# resync_workspace_stub_version() pattern above. The "**Installation Date**"
# header line is deliberately left untouched: it records the ORIGINAL install
# date, not a last-touched date, and resync has no business rewriting that.

# ---------- refresh the Loom-managed .gitignore block (#4280) ----------
#
# The marker-delimited managed block in the consumer's .gitignore is written by
# `loom-daemon init` at install time and was NEVER refreshed by resync — so a
# repo installed by a stale binary (or before a pattern was added) keeps ignoring
# the old set forever, leaving newer runtime dirs (e.g. .loom/sweep-checkpoint/,
# .loom/worktrees-local/) untracked-and-unignored. The ephemeral-pattern list is
# single-sourced in the daemon (EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS), so we invoke the daemon's
# `update-gitignore` subcommand rather than duplicating the list in shell. A
# missing/too-old binary is a LOUD stderr warning, never a silent skip.

# ---------- ensure the install-metadata.json merge=ours driver (#4528) ----------
#
# .loom/install-metadata.json is a machine-local install stamp: every host's
# resync (the restamp_metadata step above) re-writes loom_version,
# loom_commit, and last_resync (plus loom_source, an absolute host-specific
# path) on every run. Because the file must stay tracked (it is the
# authoritative ownership manifest consumed by verify-install.sh and
# uninstall-loom.sh — see is_untracked_runtime_file() in verify-install.sh,
# which already treats its exact byte content as non-checksum-tracked
# runtime state), any two hosts that each commit a resync and then
# `git merge`/`git pull` the other's commit collide on this file, every
# time, on the exact same lines.
#
# The fix: a `merge=ours` attribute for the path in a Loom-managed marker
# block in .gitattributes (committed, shared) plus the `ours` driver enabled
# in LOCAL (never committed) git config -- `git config merge.ours.driver
# true` -- which git-attributes(5) requires a `merge=ours` attribute to be
# paired with. This is safe because the file is fully re-derived by the
# next resync regardless of which side "wins" a given merge conflict.
#
# Runs on every resync (including a fresh, non-dry-run first run on an
# existing install predating this fix) so existing hosts self-heal the
# first time they resync after upgrading past #4528, with no separate
# migration step required.

# lands on disk untracked-and-unignored and would otherwise trip
# audit_untracked_loom_paths()'s "add this to EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS" warning
# even though it is a tracked-payload file the consumer should simply commit
# (#6173). `.claude/biome.jsonc` is the same kind of payload but lives
# outside `.loom/`, so it never reaches audit_untracked_loom_paths() (which
# only scans paths under `.loom/`) -- it is classified here anyway so
# suggest_commit_if_resync_only_dirt() (which scans the whole tree) also
# recognizes it as resync-only dirt safe to suggest committing.

#
# After the block refresh, anything STILL surfacing as untracked-and-unignored
# under .loom/ needs a remedy -- but which remedy depends on what the path IS.
# A path under a pure-copy surface (.loom/hooks|scripts|roles|docs|runtimes|bin/)
# is shipped payload: it arrived via resync from defaults/, so the fix is simply
# to commit it. Anything else is presumed genuine Loom runtime state the
# EPHEMERAL_PATTERNS list does not yet cover (an enumerated list always trails
# reality) -- surface it as a warning so it can be added there, instead of
# silently dirtying the consumer's `git status` (or being swept into a commit
# by `git add -A`). `git status --porcelain` already excludes ignored files, so
# every `??` entry here is by definition untracked-and-unignored; tracked
# install-owned files never appear, and a path already shadowed by an
# overbroad gitignore pattern (the installer's separate OVERBROAD_LOOM_PATTERNS
# hard-fail, loom-daemon/src/init/post_init.rs) is ignored rather than
# untracked, so `git status` excludes it here too -- it is never double-reported.

# ---------- hint: stage + commit resync-only dirt (#4332) ----------
#
# In the loom source repo itself (DEFAULTS_DIR resolved locally, i.e. this
# repo tracks its own installed surfaces under git), a resync that changed
# tracked files leaves the tree dirty until that dirt is committed — and
# `main_health_gate.rs`'s dirty-tree check (#4332) only recognizes it as safe
# *resync* dirt (ignorable, not an operator edit worth halting the gate for),
# it never commits on the operator's behalf. Print the exact command so this
# doesn't linger as a standing "not evaluated (dirty-tree)" skip. Cheap and
# best-effort: only fires when every dirty/untracked path is one this run's
# surfaces cover (or the re-stamped install-metadata.json); any other dirt
# (a genuine operator edit) suppresses the hint entirely.
