# verify-proposal-refs.sh - Verify every path / path:line / "tracked N files"
# claim in a drafted Hermit or Architect proposal body against origin/main of
# the CURRENT workspace, before the proposal is filed (issue #7658).
#
# Hermit and Architect proposals go straight to Champion — unlike Curator,
# nothing mechanically checks that a cited path exists, that a cited line
# range is real, or that a "tracked" claim (e.g. "six tracked `.pyc` files")
# matches `git ls-files`. On 2026-09-14 this produced proposals citing paths
# from a sibling repo the proposer had read, a nonexistent test file, and a
# false tracked-file count — each costing two Champion evaluations plus an
# operator escalation.
#
# What this script checks, extracted from the body file:
#   1. `path`, `path:L`, `path:L1-L2` references — backticked or bare — whose
#      first path segment matches a real top-level entry of `origin/main`
#      (a "recognized top-level dir/file"). Existence is checked with
#      `git ls-tree -r origin/main --name-only`; line ranges are checked
#      against `git show origin/main:<path> | wc -l`.
#   2. "<N> tracked `<pattern>` files" claims (N as a digit or one..ten
#      spelled out) — checked against `git ls-files -- <pattern>`.
#
# Every miss is listed; the script exits non-zero if there is at least one.
#
# Workspace rooting (#7658, Ask item 4): this script NEVER targets a sibling
# checkout. It resolves the repo to check against from $LOOM_WORKSPACE if
# set, else $PWD — always the dispatched workspace, never a hardcoded or
# discovered sibling clone.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify-proposal-refs.sh <body-file>
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - every reference and tracked-claim checks out (including "none found")
#   1 - one or more references/claims are misses (listed on stdout)
#   2 - usage error or prerequisites missing (no body file, not a git repo,
#       origin/main unreachable from the workspace)

# names conventional across many kinds of repos (software and otherwise).
#
# (a) alone would MISS the exact failure this script exists to catch: a
# citation like `verification/_repo_utils.py` copied from a sibling repo,
# whose top segment ("verification") by definition does not exist in the
# target workspace — treating "not a top-level entry here" as "not a path
# reference" would silently skip precisely the false citation we need to
# flag. (b) alone would fail to recognize this repo's own less-common
# top-level dirs. The union recognizes both.
#
# This still filters out ordinary prose that merely contains a slash
# ("and/or", "his/her", "3/4", date-like "2026/09/14") because those first
# segments match neither list.

# test in is_recognized_top() below, so a leading/trailing-newline-delimited
# string plus a bash `case` glob is an exact substitute -- and it spawns no
# subprocess per lookup, unlike a `grep -qxF` over the same data.
