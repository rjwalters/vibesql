#!/usr/bin/env bash
# loom-daemon-start.sh - Safe start wrapper for the RAW loom-daemon process
# (the autonomous work-finder + main-health-gate host — epic #3809, Phase D
# #3813).
#
# This is NOT the tmux agent pool. `.loom/bin/loom start` (loom-start.sh)
# manages the Manual-Orchestration-Mode tmux pool; THIS script backgrounds the
# `loom-daemon` binary itself, which hosts the autonomous forge-polling work
# finder (#3810) and the reactive main-health gate (#3812). The two process
# models are independent and can coexist.
#
# It:
#   - locates the loom-daemon binary,
#   - runs the (advisory, never-blocking) host-sleep check (#3350),
#   - starts a plain reliability daemon with BOTH autonomous loops OFF by
#     default (matching the ecosystem-wide opt-in / default-off contract:
#     LOOM_WORK_FINDER unset => off, LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE unset => off). Opt in
#     explicitly with --work-finder / --health-gate, or hand control to
#     .loom/config.json -> autonomous with --from-config (#3911),
#   - on macOS, backgrounds the daemon as a launchd LaunchAgent (#3972) in the
#     resolved per-user domain (`gui/<uid>` when a GUI login is active, else
#     `user/<uid>` — #4130, so it can also be (re)started headlessly over SSH)
#     so it survives the launching session's death instead of a plain `nohup ...
#     &`; on a systemd Linux host, installs + enables a `systemd --user` service
#     (#4268) that mirrors the launchd contract (Restart=on-success,
#     disable-on-stop, LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd) — see --no-systemd for the
#     escape hatch; on a non-systemd Linux host (or with --no-systemd) it stays a
#     plain nohup background job,
#   - arms the autonomy-loss watchdog (#4011): on Darwin a SECOND launchd
#     StartInterval job, on a systemd Linux host a `<unit>-watchdog.timer` +
#     `.service` pair (#4260 sub-issue D) — both drive the SAME
#     loom-daemon-watchdog.sh payload on a recurring interval, independent of
#     the daemon job/unit, so a wedged or dead daemon still gets checked,
#   - self-heals a watchdog-provisioning GAP (#5343): if the daemon was armed
#     by a path other than a fresh start here (e.g. `fleet add-worker`'s
#     hand-rolled systemd unit install, or the daemon's own startup marker
#     healing, #4331) the autonomy-desired marker can end up present with NO
#     watchdog ever provisioned. Re-running this script against an
#     ALREADY-RUNNING daemon now provisions the missing watchdog before
#     exiting (rather than a bare "already running" no-op), or — on a
#     platform tier with no scheduled-job mechanism at all — files ONE
#     tracking issue instead of leaving the gap as a status line nobody reads,
#   - backgrounds the daemon and writes a PID file (.loom/.daemon.pid),
#   - persists the resolved invocation flags to .loom/.daemon.flags so
#     `loom-daemon-update.sh` (#3968) can restart with EXACTLY the same
#     autonomy flags after a rebuild — never wider,
#   - surfaces the singleton-guard refusal (#3806) legibly instead of leaving a
#     silently-exited background process.
#
# Default is FLAGS-OFF: a bare `loom-daemon-start.sh` does NOT auto-dispatch
# sweeps. This is a deliberate safe default — enable autonomy explicitly.
#
# macOS session-bootstrap hazard (#3972): a plain `nohup "$DAEMON_BIN" &`
# leaves the process wired into the LAUNCHING SESSION's Mach bootstrap
# namespace. When that session dies (a Claude Code session crash, a closed
# terminal, a dropped SSH connection) the daemon and every child it spawns
# start failing XPC lookups to trustd (cert verification -- `gh` TLS errors)
# and opendirectoryd (`getpwuid` -- "No user exists for uid N" from `git`),
# with NO crash and no obvious log signal beyond those downstream errors. This
# is why "start it from a terminal that might die" is unsafe on macOS. This
# script defaults to loading the daemon as a `launchd` LaunchAgent on Darwin
# specifically to avoid that failure mode; see --no-launchd below for the
# escape hatch and daemon-reference.md Operability for the incident writeup.
#
# launchd domain (#4130): the LaunchAgent is loaded into the domain
# resolve_launchd_domain() (lib/launchd-domain.sh) picks — `gui/<uid>` when a
# GUI (Aqua) login session is active (byte-for-byte the pre-#4130 behavior),
# else the background per-user `user/<uid>` domain that sshd instantiates, so a
# headless / SSH-only start no longer fails with `error 125: Domain does not
# support specified action`. Override with LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh                 Reliability daemon (both loops OFF)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --work-finder   Enable the autonomous work finder
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --health-gate   Enable the main-health gate
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --work-finder --health-gate   Both loops ON
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --from-config   Enable per .loom/config.json only
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-work-finder    Force work finder OFF (explicit)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-health-gate    Force health gate OFF (explicit)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --from-config --work-finder   Config-driven, but FORCE the work finder on (#4353)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --from-config --no-health-gate   Config-driven, but FORCE the health gate off (#4353)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --foreground    Run in the foreground (no PID file)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-launchd    macOS only: use legacy nohup instead of a LaunchAgent
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --no-systemd    Linux only: use legacy nohup instead of a systemd --user service
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --print-plist   Print the LaunchAgent plist that WOULD be installed and exit (no side effects)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --print-unit    Print the systemd --user unit that WOULD be installed and exit (no side effects)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --force-env     Acknowledge an intentional narrower re-render (#4522) -- actually DROPS env keys missing from this invocation's env; without it, dropped keys are carried forward from the installed unit/plist by default (#5344)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --heal-watchdog-only   Re-provision a missing watchdog job/timer (#5343's heal_watchdog_provisioning_gap) and exit -- never touches the PID file or attempts to start/stop a daemon (#5405)
#   ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh --help
#
# Environment:
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN     Path to the loom-daemon binary (else auto-detected)
#   LOOM_SOCKET_PATH    Override the daemon socket (default ~/.loom/loom-daemon.sock)
#   LOOM_PID_FILE       OUTPUT, not input (#6420). This script is the EXPORTER of
#                        the pid-file path -- it derives "<state home>/.daemon.pid"
#                        and exports/bakes it into the plist/unit for the daemon
#                        and every reader (loom-daemon-stop.sh, -update.sh,
#                        -watchdog.sh, daemon_pidfile.rs), all of which DO honor an
#                        inbound value as tier 1 (#6386/#5118). An inbound value is
#                        deliberately ignored HERE; to place the pid file elsewhere,
#                        move the state home (LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT / the repo root
#                        $PWD resolves to). See the rationale at the export site.
#   LOOM_WORK_FINDER / LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE  Respected when already exported
#                        (always wins, even under --from-config -- #4353)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_LAUNCHD  macOS only: 0/false/no forces the legacy nohup path (same as --no-launchd)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_SYSTEMD  Linux only: 0/false/no forces the legacy nohup path (same as --no-systemd)
#   LOOM_SYSTEMD_UNIT    Linux only: override the systemd --user unit name (default loom-daemon.service)
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_LABEL  Override the watchdog job identifier (macOS: LaunchAgent
#                        label, default <daemon label>-watchdog; systemd Linux:
#                        service/timer unit basename, default <daemon unit>-watchdog)
#   LOOM_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_SECS  Watchdog check cadence in seconds (default 300) —
#                        macOS StartInterval / systemd OnUnitActiveSec+OnBootSec
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL   macOS only: override the LaunchAgent label (default com.rjwalters.loom-daemon)
#   LOOM_LAUNCHD_DOMAIN  macOS only: pin the launchd domain (e.g. gui/$(id -u) or
#                        user/$(id -u)); honored verbatim, else auto-resolved
#                        gui→user (#4130). A pinned domain that does not resolve
#                        fails loudly at bootstrap rather than falling back.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_PATH        Full override for the rendered plist's PATH (#4172).
#                        Used verbatim -- no canonical fallback is appended. For
#                        a host that needs a wholly custom PATH.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_PATH_EXTRA  Extra dir(s) to prepend onto the canonical minimal
#                        PATH (#4172) instead of overriding it entirely -- for
#                        a host that needs one or two additional dirs (e.g. a
#                        project-local toolchain) without inheriting the WHOLE
#                        invoking shell's interactive PATH.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BOOTOUT_SETTLE_SECS  macOS/launchd only (#5081): max seconds to
#                        poll `launchctl print` after a `bootout`, waiting for
#                        the old job to actually leave the bootstrap namespace,
#                        before attempting `bootstrap` (default 5). `bootout`
#                        is asynchronous; an immediate `bootstrap` can race it
#                        and fail with "Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output
#                        error" even against a valid plist.
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BOOTSTRAP_RETRY_ATTEMPTS  macOS/launchd only (#5081): max
#                        `launchctl bootstrap` attempts when it keeps failing
#                        with that same async-race I/O error (default 4).
#                        Never retries on any OTHER bootstrap failure (a
#                        genuinely bad plist/permission problem a retry cannot
#                        fix).
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BOOTSTRAP_RETRY_SECS  macOS/launchd only (#5081): seconds to
#                        sleep between bootstrap retries (default 2).
#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT  Machine mode (Epic #3835 Phase 3b, #4229): set by
#                        the `scripts/loom` dispatcher to the resolved
#                        ~/.local/share/loom checkout before it execs this
#                        script. When set, the plist's WorkingDirectory and the
#                        pid/flags home resolve from THIS path -- not from
#                        $PWD -- so `loom start` manages the SAME machine-wide
#                        singleton daemon no matter which repo it is run from.
#                        Direct invocation of this script (the existing dev
#                        workflow) never sets it and is unaffected: $PWD-based
#                        find_repo_root() stays the fallback. See
#                        defaults/docs/machine-dispatcher.md.

# ---------- silent autonomy-downgrade detection (#4693, hardened #5409) ----------
# Incident 2026-07-30: a routine loom-daemon-start.sh run (no flags) silently
# re-rendered the plist with LOOM_WORK_FINDER=0 -- downgrading a previously
# autonomous daemon to FLAGS-OFF with NO warning. ~3h of dispatch outage (23
# ready issues sat queued, "work availability is the limiter") before the
# missing "work_finder: starting" log line was traced back to the plist env.
#
# Incident 2026-08-05 (#5409): the #4693 mitigation below (a WARNING, never
# blocking) was NOT enough -- it recurred, on the RECOVERY path specifically:
# an operator ran the exact command `loom-daemon status` itself recommends
# ("Recover with: ./.loom/scripts/cli/loom-daemon-start.sh"), the WARNING
# scrolled past in the recovery output, and the fleet host lost ~1h of
# dispatch with a daemon reporting perfectly healthy the whole time. #5409
# resolved the issue's own "asymmetry worth weighing" (a wrongly-preserved-on
# daemon is trivially visible and reversible; a wrongly-silenced-off daemon
# looks like a healthy, quiet fleet) in favor of erring toward NOT silently
# downgrading: a DETECTED downgrade on a REAL start now REFUSES to proceed
# (exit 1) rather than warn-and-continue, until the operator states the
# desired value for THIS invocation explicitly. --print-plist / --print-unit
# stay warn-only (see the $PRINT_PLIST/$PRINT_UNIT guard in
# warn_autonomy_downgrade below) -- they are read-only preview modes with no
# side effect to block, and refusing them would make it IMPOSSIBLE to inspect
# what a real start would render.
#
# The FLAGS-OFF default for a PLAIN, GENUINELY FRESH start (#3911 -- no prior
# plist/unit, no marker) is correct and stays completely unchanged -- this
# only closes the SILENT part of a transition FROM autonomous TO FLAGS-OFF.
#
# Signals consulted (either alone is sufficient to flag a downgrade):
#   1. the PRIOR installed plist/unit had the key ON (=1) -- direct evidence
#      this daemon was running autonomously a moment ago.
#   1b. (#5437) when no plist/unit exists to consult (always true on the nohup
#      fallback tier -- no plist/unit is EVER rendered there), fall back to the
#      work_finder=/health_gate= fields write_intent_marker() persists into the
#      marker itself on every successful start -- the actual prior flag value,
#      not just "a daemon started here at some point". This is what lets a
#      bare restart following a PRIOR bare start on that tier stay silent
#      (old value was already "0" -- no transition) while a bare restart
#      following a PRIOR autonomous start still correctly falls through to #2.
#   2. the autonomy-desired marker (#4011) is present but NEITHER the prior
#      plist/unit NOR the marker's own persisted fields yielded a value (e.g.
#      the first Darwin start after a nohup-only history whose marker predates
#      #5437) -- marker presence alone is recorded operator intent, and the
#      issue explicitly calls this combination out.
# When the prior value was already "0" (no transition) this stays silent --
# a standing marker-vs-FLAGS-OFF mismatch with no fresh transition is
# `loom-daemon status`'s job to flag (a non-OK/exit-code signal as of #5409),
# not this one-shot start-time check.
#
# Deliberately NOT triggered by:
#   - --from-config (control is explicitly handed to .loom/config.json --
#     not a silent default; see the FROM_CONFIG guard in the caller),
#   - an explicit --no-work-finder / --no-health-gate THIS invocation (an
#     explicit ask is not silent -- this is precisely the "state it
#     explicitly" escape hatch #5409 asks for),
#   - an operator-exported LOOM_WORK_FINDER=0 / LOOM_MAIN_HEALTH_GATE=0 in the
#     calling shell (also an explicit, non-default signal -- "Respected when
#     already exported", see the Environment section in the help banner).

    # defaults, both env-overridable (an already-exported value always wins):
    #   * LOOM_GUARD_DECISION_LOG=1 — capture every guard DENY/ASK to
    #     .loom/logs/guard-decisions.log so the standing per-trigger review policy
    #     (see CLAUDE.md → "Autonomous guard defaults") can dedup by pattern and
    #     file one issue per distinct trigger. Off by default outside autonomous
    #     mode; here we opt it on so the feedback loop actually has data.
    #   * LOOM_FORCE_SCOPE=protected — allow an agent to force-push / hard-reset its
    #     OWN working branch without a stall, while force-push to a protected branch
    #     (main/master/default) stays a hard DENY via ALWAYS_BLOCK_PATTERNS. This is
    #     the Loom-recommended force-scope for autonomous repos.
    # Children inherit these through the daemon's process environment. This is a
    # DELIBERATE, agent-wide (not per-invocation) export: there is no mechanism to
    # scope an env var to only the guard hook's own PreToolUse invocations without
    # also handing it to every OTHER subprocess the dispatched agent spawns —
    # `export`/`Command::env` inheritance is transitive to the whole child tree.
    #
    # KNOWN CONSEQUENCE (#5388): a dispatched agent that runs a *managed repo's
    # own* guard-hook test suite (one that asserts the guard's FACTORY-DEFAULT
    # force-push/reset-hard `ask` tier or decision-log-off behavior, e.g.
    # `hooks/repo/tests/test-guard-destructive.sh`) will see these two ambient
    # values override exactly the defaults under test — a clean shell run and a
    # dispatched-agent run of the identical suite, on the identical commit, can
    # disagree by dozens of failures. An agent that does not know its own
    # environment is non-default has no way to distinguish "main is broken" from
    # "my environment is lying to me" — this caused a Builder to close a valid

# render_launchd_plist <label> <daemon_bin> <workdir> <log_path>
# Prints the LaunchAgent plist XML to stdout. Mirrors the hand-written plist
# that validated the #3972 fix during the incident
# (~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.rjwalters.loom-daemon.plist): RunAtLoad=true
# (the daemon also comes back after a reboot/re-login, not just a session
# death -- strictly more durable than the pre-#3972 nohup contract, which
# didn't survive a reboot either).
#
# KeepAlive is `{ SuccessfulExit: true }` as of the supervised restart primitive
# (#4054, Phase 2 of #4017): launchd relaunches the job ONLY when it exits with
# status 0, and leaves it down on any non-zero exit. This is what lets the
# daemon END and reliably COME BACK on demand -- the `RestartDaemon` IPC request
# (loom-daemon restart) is the ONLY path that exits 0, so it is the only thing
# that trips a relaunch. Crucially this PRESERVES the old no-crash-loop semantics
# of KeepAlive=false: a crashed/panicked daemon, a SIGTERM'd operator stop (exit
# 143), and a SIGINT/Ctrl-C (exit 130) all exit NON-ZERO, so launchd does NOT
# respawn them. Making the exit code carry intent (daemon side, #4054) is also
# what closes the SuccessfulExit/bootout race (Curator Finding 1): an operator
# stop exits non-zero, so launchd never relaunches it during the stop window --
# "an operator stop stays stopped" no longer depends on bootout timing. The
# bootout in loom-daemon-stop.sh is demoted to belt-and-braces (it still unloads
# the definition so it does not come back at the next login).
#
# LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=launchd is baked into the plist env so the daemon can
# PROVE it is supervised before it will exit for a restart. It is hardcoded here
# (not harvested from the caller's env) so it lands in EVERY rendered plist --
# and, conversely, is ABSENT from the nohup path (which never renders a plist),
# so an unsupervised daemon correctly refuses to exit on a restart request
# (nothing would bring it back). Because it survives in the plist, the relaunched
# daemon still sees it.
#
# The PATH baked into the plist is DETERMINISTIC (#4172), not derived from the
# invoking shell's PATH. It used to be "$PATH:<fallback>" -- the invoking
# shell/session's ENTIRE interactive PATH prefixed onto a fallback set -- so a
# re-render (e.g. a `loom-daemon-update.sh --relaunch` run from an interactive
# terminal with a large project-specific PATH) silently replaced whatever PATH
# the live plist carried with whoever's shell happened to run the roll:
# non-hermetic, non-reproducible across hosts/sessions, and able to let an
# unrelated toolchain earlier in that PATH shadow the binaries the daemon and
# its sweep children expect (gh/git/cargo/python3). resolve_plist_path() (see
# above) instead resolves, in order: an explicit LOOM_DAEMON_PATH override
# (verbatim), LOOM_DAEMON_PATH_EXTRA prepended onto the canonical minimal PATH,
# or the canonical minimal PATH alone (~/.local/bin, ~/.cargo/bin, Homebrew,
# standard bin dirs -- the same fallback set this always carried, just no
# longer prefixed with the invoking shell's PATH). It is computed exactly once
# per script invocation into $PLIST_PATH_VALUE and logs its choice to stderr.
# Every already-exported LOOM_* / GH_TOKEN / GITEA_TOKEN / FORGE_TOKEN var is
# still forwarded verbatim so the launchd job sees EXACTLY the autonomy flags
# and auth this invocation resolved -- never wider, never narrower (#3972 AC:
# "preserves the current flag semantics").
#
# Reconciling this STATIC forwarding with the #4430 MINTED GitHub App token
# path (deliberate, not an oversight): `LOOM_GITHUB_APP_ID` /
# `LOOM_GITHUB_APP_KEY_PATH` already match the `LOOM_[A-Za-z0-9_]*` pattern
# above, so they ride along into the plist exactly like any other LOOM_* flag
# -- but note that's a non-secret app id and a *path* to the private key, never
# the key material itself (which stays on disk wherever the operator put it,
# read only by openssl at mint time). Any GH_TOKEN forwarded here is this
# invocation's snapshot at RENDER time; the daemon's own #4430 preflight/
# refresh loop calls `std::env::set_var("GH_TOKEN", …)` on its OWN process
# environment once a fresh installation token is minted, which the plist's
# static value cannot see or fight (it only seeds the daemon's env at
# process start, same as it always did) -- every `gh`/`git` child spawned
# AFTER that point inherits the live, minted value, not the stale plist one.
# If minting ever fails (revoked/unreadable key, network hiccup), the daemon
# falls back to whatever GH_TOKEN this static forwarding already provided --
# so leaving GH_TOKEN forwarding in place is exactly the right fallback
# layer, not a footgun to remove.

# ---------- systemd --user unit rendering (#4268) ----------
# render_systemd_unit <daemon_bin> <workdir> <log_path>
# Prints the `systemd --user` service unit to stdout. Pure string rendering --
# safe to call on ANY platform (used by --print-unit for inspection/testing); the
# `systemctl --user` invocation that consumes it is gated to a systemd Linux host
# separately, below. This is the Linux mirror of render_launchd_plist:
#
#   * Restart=on-success is the exact analog of the launchd
#     KeepAlive:{SuccessfulExit:true} contract (#4054): systemd relaunches the
#     service ONLY when it exits with status 0 (the RestartDaemon primitive), and
#     leaves it down on any non-zero exit -- a crash/panic, a SIGTERM operator
#     stop (143), a SIGINT/Ctrl-C (130) -- so it preserves the no-crash-loop
#     semantics while making the one deliberate clean exit the only relaunch
#     trigger. Crash relaunch (Restart=always/on-failure) is deliberately NOT set
#     here -- that is watchdog territory (sub-issue D of #4260).
#   * KillMode=mixed (#4862): a self-update relaunch calls exit(0) while the
#     daemon's own `claude`/`tee`/`sleep` worker children (spawned sweeps, in
#     the SAME cgroup) may still be running. Under the default KillMode=
#     control-group, systemd's kill(5) escalates to SIGKILLing those leftover
#     processes only after the FULL TimeoutStopSec deadline elapses -- and a
#     forced-timeout SIGKILL sets the UNIT's Result to 'timeout', which
#     Restart=on-success does NOT match (only 'success' does -- see the
#     Restart= table in systemd.service(5)), so the relaunch never fires and
#     the daemon sits dead. Empirically verified (see #4862): a clean exit(0)
#     with lingering cgroup children reproduces Result=timeout under
#     control-group and Result=success (Restart=on-success DOES fire) under
#     mixed. Per kill(5): "If set to mixed, the SIGTERM signal is sent to the
#     main process while the subsequent SIGKILL signal is sent to all
#     remaining processes... after: the main process of a unit has exited
#     (applies to KillMode=: mixed)" -- i.e. mixed escalates to SIGKILL
#     IMMEDIATELY on the main process's own exit, never waiting out
#     TimeoutStopSec, so the unit's Result tracks the main process's own exit
#     status. This does not change genuine-crash semantics (still Result=
#     exit-code / signal, still refused by on-success) -- verified with both
#     shapes in test-loom-daemon-start.sh.
#   * TimeoutStopSec=20 (#4950): a fast-failure backstop well below systemd's
#     90s default -- see the printf site below for the full sizing rationale
#     (both the RestartDaemon primitive and the operator-stop SIGTERM handler
#     exit near-instantly, so a healthy daemon never approaches 20s). Without
#     this, a stop-transition that DOES stall (e.g. a stale unit predating
#     KillMode=mixed above, still lingering on an already-provisioned host)
#     drags out the default 90s before landing the unit in `failed (Result:
#     timeout)` -- the exact 2026-08-02 incident `loom-daemon-update.sh`'s
#     #4950 restart-verification poll now detects and self-heals.
#   * SuccessExitStatus=143 130 + RestartPreventExitStatus=143 130 (#6129): a
#     clean operator stop (SIGTERM->143, SIGINT->130, see ipc.rs's
#     EXIT_SIGTERM/EXIT_SIGINT) was landing the unit in `failed`, not
#     `inactive` -- see the printf site below for the full classification +
#     safety rationale.
#   * [Install] WantedBy=default.target + `systemctl --user enable` is the
#     RunAtLoad=true analog: the service comes up on login (and, with
#     `loginctl enable-linger`, after a reboot).
#   * LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR=systemd is baked in (hardcoded, not env-harvested) so
#     the daemon can PROVE it is supervised before it exits for a restart (#4054,
#     recognized daemon-side by detect_supervisor() since PR #4298 / #4267) -- and,
#     conversely, is ABSENT from the nohup path, so an unsupervised daemon
#     correctly refuses to exit on a restart request.
#   * The PATH baked in is the SAME deterministic value as the launchd plist
#     (#4172, $PLIST_PATH_VALUE), not the invoking shell's PATH; every already-
#     exported LOOM_* / GH_TOKEN / GITEA_TOKEN / FORGE_TOKEN var is forwarded
#     verbatim so the service sees EXACTLY the autonomy flags + auth this
#     invocation resolved -- never wider, never narrower. See
#     render_launchd_plist's #4430 reconciliation note above -- this static
#     forwarding and the daemon's own minted-GitHub-App-token refresh loop
#     are complementary (static = render-time seed/fallback, minted = live
#     process-env override), never in conflict.

# an operator-initiated loom-daemon-stop.sh removes it, and it is deliberately
# PRESERVED across the internal stop loom-daemon-update.sh performs (via
# LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_KEEP_INTENT). The host-side watchdog (loom-daemon-watchdog.sh)
# reads it to decide whether a missing daemon is a silent failure (marker present
# ⇒ report) or a deliberate stop (marker absent ⇒ stay silent). Records the paths
# and label the watchdog needs so it can probe reality without re-deriving them.

# plain-nohup fallback -- both previously wrote identical `use_launchd=false`

# ---------- calibrate binding-ceiling hint (#4390, re-based on #4512) ----------
# `loom-daemon calibrate` is purely file/host-based (no running daemon
# required, unlike `status`), so it is safe to run right here at start time.
# One advisory line, printed only when `autonomous.workFinder.maxConcurrent` is
# CURRENTLY the binding term AND the host is measurably idle -- i.e. this machine
# is under-subscribed at its current knob.
#
# #4512 changed the basis: calibrate no longer computes a *recommended* value
# (the CPU-headroom term it derived one from is gone; maxConcurrent is now a
# per-machine knob tuned empirically), so the hint reports the observed idle
# fraction instead of a number to copy.
# Never fatal: a missing jq, a calibrate error, or an unparseable payload all
# fall through silently -- this is advisory-only, exactly like
# print_safehouse_status above.
#
# BOUNDED (#4799): `calibrate` is normally file/host-based and fast (see
# above), but a `$DAEMON_BIN` with no `calibrate` handler at all -- a test
# fixture stub, or a future breaking CLI change -- makes the `$(...)` below
# block forever, exactly like the #4773 leak incident this call reproduced
# verbatim under the #4790 judge's hard-kill repro. Worse, a signal arriving
# while THIS script is blocked inside that command substitution is deferred
# until the substitution returns -- which for a truly-wedged child never
# happens -- so even loom-daemon-start.sh's own EXIT/INT/TERM traps cannot
# fire in that state. bounded_run() (lib/bounded-run.sh, shared with
# loom-daemon-watchdog.sh's IPC probe, #4398) guarantees the substitution
# always returns, closing that gap. If the lib failed to source for any

#     re-fires the oneshot service every interval independent of the last run's
#     exit status.

# ---------- watchdog self-heal for an ALREADY-RUNNING daemon (#5343) ----------
# Root cause (#5343): the watchdog job/timer was previously provisioned ONLY as
# a side effect of a FRESH loom-daemon-start.sh run reaching the
# launchd/systemd install branch (the unconditional provision_watchdog_job_*
# calls further down this file). Two paths leave the autonomy-desired marker
# present with NO watchdog ever provisioned:
#   1. `loom-daemon fleet add-worker` (loom-daemon/src/fleet/add_worker.rs)
#      hand-installs the `loom-daemon.service` systemd --user unit directly
#      (its own render_daemon_unit()) and never calls this script at all, so
#      its watchdog-provisioning branch never runs.
#   2. The daemon's own startup marker-healing (autonomy_marker.rs, #4331):
#      whenever a supervised daemon starts (LOOM_DAEMON_SUPERVISOR set — which
#      fleet add-worker's hand-rolled unit DOES set) with the marker absent, the
#      DAEMON PROCESS ITSELF re-writes the marker — independent of, and with no
#      knowledge of, the watchdog job.
# Once armed that way, the "already-running guard" just above used to `exit 0`
# immediately on ANY subsequent loom-daemon-start.sh invocation — including one
# an operator runs BY HAND specifically to check/repair the install — without
# ever reaching the watchdog-provisioning code below (which is unconditionally
# skipped whenever the running-daemon guard fires first). So even a deliberate
# re-run could not close the gap. This call makes that guard corrective instead
# of a silent no-op: marker present + watchdog job missing -> provisions it now,
# without touching the already-running daemon process at all (mirrors the
# daemon's own startup marker-healing pattern, #4331, applied to the watchdog
# side of the same "expected protection" contract).
#
# Non-fatal, and safe to call unconditionally:
#   - marker absent -> no provisioning attempt (nothing was ever "desired").
#   - marker present + job already present -> provision_watchdog_job_launchd /
#     _systemd are already idempotent (the launchd branch skips the reload
#     when already loaded and byte-identical; a bare `enable --now` on an
#     already-active systemd timer is a verified no-op, #4862) — calling them
#     again here never double-fires anything.
#   - marker present + no scheduled-job mechanism on this platform tier (the
#     nohup-fallback tier, or an explicit --no-launchd/--no-systemd escape
#     hatch) -> escalates instead of silently reporting (AC4), same as the
#     fresh-start nohup tier above.
# Platform detection is duplicated (deliberately, not shared with the real
# detection block below) because it must run BEFORE the already-running guard,
# ahead of where the real platform-detection block executes today — keeping it
# local avoids reordering the rest of this carefully-sequenced script.

# which all resolve an inbound LOOM_PID_FILE as TIER 1, ahead of this same
# derivation (#6386, #5118) -- this script deliberately does NOT read
# LOOM_PID_FILE. It WRITES it. The asymmetry is the point, not an oversight:
#
#   * One writer, N readers. `start` is the only end that CHOOSES where the pid
#     file lives; every other end must resolve whatever `start` chose. That is
#     what keeps "all ends mean the same file" true, and it is why the value is
#     exported and baked into the plist/unit below rather than re-derived by
#     each reader.
#   * The blast radius runs the OTHER WAY here. For a reader, honoring an
#     explicit LOOM_PID_FILE NARROWS what it touches -- that is precisely
#     #6386's fix (a stop that was told which pid file to use must not wander
#     onto the live one via $PWD). For `start`, honoring it WIDENS what it
#     touches: this script reads the path for its already-running guard, `rm
#     -f`s it, writes the new pid into it, and hands it to a daemon that claims
#     it. And LOOM_PID_FILE is AMBIENT in any Loom agent session -- this very
#     export lands in the daemon's env and is inherited by every sweep/agent
#     child it spawns (observed on a worker host; see the header of
#     defaults/scripts/tests/lib/live-state-sandbox.sh). Honoring it would mean
#     a `start` run inside a scratch fixture silently claims, rewrites, and
#     `rm -f`s the LIVE daemon's pid file -- incident #5179's exact shape, with
#     the resulting FALSE `degraded` liveness verdict for the operator and a
#     poisoned watchdog input.
#   * Nothing is lost. A caller who needs the pid file somewhere else moves the
#     STATE HOME (LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT, or the repo root $PWD resolves to),
#     which this script does honor -- an unambiguous, deliberate act rather
#     than an inherited env var.
