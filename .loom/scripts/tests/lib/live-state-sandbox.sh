# live-state-sandbox.sh — ONE shared "sandbox every live daemon state path"
# helper for the loom-daemon lifecycle test suites (issue #5179).
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# The daemon lifecycle suites deliberately execute the REAL
# loom-daemon-start.sh / loom-daemon-stop.sh / loom-daemon-update.sh (not
# mocks), so every state path those scripts resolve is a path the test can
# write. Four separate incidents were each fixed by enumerating ONE more
# surface after it leaked:
#
#   1. #4078/#4087 — a daemon test booted out the operator's PRODUCTION daemon
#      (launchd label + label-blind pgrep; fixed in lib/launchd-sandbox.sh).
#   2. #5131 — the live `autonomy-desired` marker was removed under a running
#      daemon (fixed by a per-suite LOOM_AUTONOMY_MARKER export).
#   3. #5179 — the live `.daemon.pid` was rewritten under a running daemon,
#      producing a FALSE `degraded` liveness verdict for the operator and
#      poisoning the watchdog's (#5118/#5126) primary input.
#   4. #5501 — a harness fully sandboxed on every STATE PATH still stopped the
#      operator's real daemon, because it deliberately pointed LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL
#      at the real `com.rjwalters.loom-daemon` label (to prove "default label =
#      the operator's real stop" was unchanged) — sandboxing paths does not
#      sandbox SUPERVISOR IDENTITY, which is a different axis entirely. See
#      "Supervisor IDENTITY" below.
#
# The recurring root cause is not "one more variable was forgotten"; it is that
# a Loom agent session EXPORTS the live paths into every child process it
# spawns (observed on a worker host: `LOOM_PID_FILE=$HOME/.loom/.daemon.pid`,
# `LOOM_WORKSPACE=<the real checkout>`, `LOOM_DAEMON_BIN=<the real binary>`).
# A test suite that merely *omits* an override therefore does not get a neutral
# default — it INHERITS the production path, and `LOOM_PID_FILE` is tier 1 of
# the daemon's own resolver (`daemon_pidfile.rs`), ahead of every other tier.
# #4902 fixed exactly this shape for LOOM_DAEMON_BIN; this helper generalizes
# it so a state path added to the daemon later is isolated by construction.
#
# ## What it covers
#
# `live_state_sandbox_init` owns the filesystem STATE PATHS:
#
#   LOOM_PID_FILE          -> <dir>/.daemon.pid          (daemon_pidfile.rs tier 1)
#   LOOM_AUTONOMY_MARKER   -> <dir>/autonomy-desired     (#4011/#5131)
#   LOOM_SOCKET_PATH       -> <dir>/loom-daemon.sock     (its parent is the
#                             daemon's `loom_dir`, so the heartbeat, machine-level
#                             logs and every `resolve_loom_dir()` consumer follow)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN_DIR    -> <dir>/machine-level-bin-sandbox (#4381)
#   LOOM_DAEMON_BIN        -> UNSET  (#4902: the ambient value names the REAL binary)
#   LOOM_WORKSPACE         -> UNSET  (pid-file tier 3; each sub-invocation must
#                             resolve its OWN fixture repo root instead)
#   LOOM_MACHINE_CHECKOUT  -> UNSET  (pid-file tier 2 + the scripts' machine
#                             mode, whose state home is the real $HOME/.loom)
#   $PWD                   -> <dir>  (#6386: NOT an env override — the OTHER
#                             resolution tier. `find_repo_root` walks up from
#                             the cwd, so a suite run from the live checkout
#                             hands every un-`cd`-ed sub-invocation the LIVE
#                             `.loom` as its state home. <dir> is given its own
#                             `.loom/` so it is a valid workspace root.)
#
# Supervisor IDENTITY (launchd label, systemd unit) is NOT a filesystem state
# path, so it is not fingerprinted the way the paths above are — the syscall-
# level stubbing lives in lib/launchd-sandbox.sh. But `live_state_sandbox_init`
# / `live_state_sandbox_assert_untouched` DO assert it, below: a sandbox that
# only isolated paths would have missed #5501 (a harness clean on every path
# still stopped the real daemon via a real-looking LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL). See
# `live_state_sandbox_assert_supervisor_scoped`.
#
# ## The guard
#
# Isolation alone is unfalsifiable — the previous fixes all *looked*
# complete. `live_state_sandbox_snapshot` fingerprints every live state path
# reachable from the AMBIENT environment BEFORE the sandbox is installed, and
# `live_state_sandbox_assert_untouched` re-fingerprints them at the end of the
# run, so a write to a real `.loom` state path (or the CREATION of one that was
# absent) fails the suite LOUDLY instead of being discovered in production.
# `live_state_sandbox_init` and `live_state_sandbox_assert_untouched` ALSO call
# `live_state_sandbox_assert_supervisor_scoped` — sandboxing paths is
# necessary but not sufficient (#5501): a test whose LOOM_LAUNCHD_LABEL /
# LOOM_WATCHDOG_LABEL resolve to the real production identity is not
# sandboxed, no matter how clean its state paths are.
#
# A test that genuinely needs to prove "default label = the operator's real
# stop, behaviour unchanged" must NOT do it by pointing this sandbox at the
# real label — that IS the #5501 incident shape. Use the
# `LOOM_DAEMON_STOP_DRYRUN=1` seam in loom-daemon-stop.sh instead: it resolves
# the real label/unit for inspection but never issues the real `launchctl
# bootout` / `systemctl --user disable --now` / `kill` against whatever it
# finds, so the assertion below is deliberately bypassed while it is active.
#
# Only files a healthy daemon does NOT continuously rewrite are guarded
# (see LIVE_STATE_SANDBOX_GUARDED_FILES): `daemon.heartbeat`, `daemon.log`,
# `sweeps.json` and `activity.db` are deliberately excluded because a live
# daemon updates them on its own cadence, which would make the guard flap.
#
# ## Usage (source it)
#
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/lib/live-state-sandbox.sh"
#   live_state_sandbox_snapshot                      # BEFORE any sandbox export
#   ...
#   live_state_sandbox_init "$BASE_WORKDIR/live-state"
#   ... run the suite ...
#   live_state_sandbox_assert_untouched              # rc 0 = clean, 1 = leaked

# State files that identify/steer a daemon and are written only at lifecycle
# transitions — safe to compare before/after even while a real daemon runs.
