# test-classify-dependency-block.sh - Tests for classify-dependency-block.sh
# (issue #5664), the timing-vs-merits split in Champion's escalation decision.
#
# Champion escalated a proposal to `loom:operator-only` after N=2 unrevised
# evaluations regardless of WHY it kept failing. For a proposal whose only
# finding was "hard dependency on #3, which is still open" that turned a
# self-clearing timing condition into a permanent one: `loom:operator-only`
# makes Champion skip the issue forever, so the only actor that could notice #3
# had closed was the one told to ignore it. In the motivating incident #3 merged
# minutes after three dependents were escalated on it.
#
# This suite is hybrid, mirroring test-detect-dependency-cycle.sh:
#
#   1. extract_findings / is_dependency_finding / findings_are_dependency_only /
#      _extract_refs / _fingerprint are real sourceable functions (the script
#      guards its main on `BASH_SOURCE == $0`), tested directly.
#   2. Both modes, their exit codes, and the --apply side effects are exercised
#      black-box by stubbing `gh` on PATH and running the real script.
#   3. The Champion prose call sites are pinned with literal assert_doc_contains
#      checks, so wiring the gate out of the role files fails here.
#
# Hermetic: no network, no live forge, no tokens. Every read goes to the stub.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-classify-dependency-block.sh

**Champion: Escalating to Operator — Repeated Rejection Without Revision**

This proposal has been evaluated 2+ times with converging feedback (1 posted
rejection(s) plus 1 silent skip(s) of an unchanged proposal), but has not been
revised to address it.

**Recurring findings:**
- Technical Feasibility (no obvious blockers): Hard dependency on #3, which is
  still open.

A human needs to decide whether to revise this proposal, close it, or accept it
as-is.

This issue requires additional work before promotion to `loom:issue`:

- Scope Appropriateness: this is three issues in one and cannot be built atomically.

**Recommended actions:**
