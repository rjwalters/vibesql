# test-resync-installed-local-fix-guard.sh - local-divergence protection in
# resync-installed.sh's sync_one() (#7864)
#
# Split out of test-resync-installed.sh (which is frozen by the file-size
# ratchet, .loom/docs/file-size-policy.md) rather than grown in place -- see
# that file's own header for the full fixture-based test catalog this one
# does not duplicate, and its make_fixture() for why the fixture commit
# message there deliberately matches the "routine resync" lineage pattern
# this suite is built around.
#
# Reproduces the incident this protection exists for, first hit and fixed
# downstream at `2AMLogic/sky130-modexp` (its #98/#100, fixed in PR #117):
# sync_one() used to overwrite an installed file unconditionally whenever it
# differed from defaults/, with no diff review and no way to tell "upstream
# moved forward" from "upstream's defaults/ has not caught up with a fix that
# landed directly on the INSTALLED copy". A resync in that second state
# silently reverted a merged, tested guard-hook fix this way.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.loom/scripts/tests/test-resync-installed-local-fix-guard.sh
