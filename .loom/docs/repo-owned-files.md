# Repo-owned files inside `.loom/`

`.loom/` is a Loom-managed tree, but it is not *exclusively* Loom's. Some of it
is an **extension point**: `.loom/hooks/post-worktree.sh`, for example, is a
file Loom never ships and always invokes (`worktree.sh` runs it after creating
a worktree), so a repo that wants per-worktree setup is *expected* to add its
own file there.

This page states the ownership rule the installer applies, and how a repo
declares "this file is mine" so an upgrade cannot delete it.

## The rule

On reinstall (`install.sh --confirm-reinstall`, `loom update`, a direct
`loom-daemon init --force`), Loom cleans each managed `.loom/` directory —
`roles/`, `scripts/`, `hooks/`, `docs/`, `runtimes/`, `bin/` — before copying
the new version in. A file already sitting in one of those directories is
**deleted only when Loom can attribute it to itself**:

| Evidence | Outcome |
|---|---|
| The current `defaults/` tree ships a file at that path | **Removed**, then immediately re-copied (net effect: refreshed) |
| The path is pinned in `.loom/resync-ignore` | **Preserved** — declared repo-owned |
| The path is listed in `.loom/install-metadata.json`'s `installed_files` | **Removed** — Loom installed it, so Loom may retire it |
| None of the above | **Preserved** and reported as unmanaged |

The last row is the important one: **no evidence means no deletion.** A stale
Loom file that survives is cosmetic drift, and the manifest-driven sweeps in
`scripts/install-loom.sh` and `scripts/uninstall-loom.sh` still retire it. A
deleted repo file is unrecoverable, and — for a hook — silently stops firing.
The two failure modes are not symmetric, so the installer errs toward keeping.

Every file the installer removes, and every file it preserves under this rule,
is **named in the installer's output**. Nothing in `.loom/` is deleted silently.

### The one place the rule is looser: an explicit `--clean` uninstall

`uninstall-loom.sh --clean` is an operator saying "wipe the managed
directories, *including* files the manifest never recorded". That request is
honored — with two exceptions:

- a path pinned in `.loom/resync-ignore` is never removed (the declaration is
  the opt-out), and
- inside `.loom/hooks/`, a file the current `defaults/` does not ship is
  preserved even without a pin. Hook scripts can never appear in
  `installed_files` (#4262), so "unrecognized" there carries no information.

Everything preserved is named in the output, same as above.

## Declaring a file repo-owned

List its `.loom/`-relative path, one per line, in `.loom/resync-ignore`:

```
# .loom/resync-ignore — paths Loom must not overwrite or delete
hooks/post-worktree.sh
scripts/project-local-helper.sh
```

Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored; matching is exact (no globs), the
same semantics `resync-installed.sh` already uses.

This is the same file that pins a customization against being *overwritten* by
`./.loom/scripts/resync-installed.sh`; it now also pins it against being
*deleted* by the installer's clean sweep. One list, one meaning: **this path is
the repo's, not Loom's.**

Commit `.loom/resync-ignore` — it is repo configuration, and the installer
never removes it.

### When you do and do not need it

- **A file Loom never ships** (`hooks/post-worktree.sh`, a project helper
  script) is already preserved on the reinstall path by the "no evidence" rule
  above. Pinning it is still worth doing: it is the only thing that protects a
  non-`hooks/` file from an explicit `--clean`, it turns an implicit outcome
  into a declared one, it moves the file out of the "unmanaged, review me"
  section of the installer's output, and it protects the file from a legacy
  over-broad `installed_files` manifest that wrongly claims Loom wrote it.
- **A file Loom *does* ship**, customized in place (e.g. your own edit of
  `hooks/guard-destructive.sh`), cannot be protected from the installer by a
  pin — the reinstall re-copies the shipped version over it by design. Pinning
  it does stop `resync-installed.sh` from overwriting it between installs. If
  you need a durable fork, give it a name Loom does not ship and wire that name
  up instead.

## Why not just delete anything unrecognized?

That is what the sweep used to do, and it deleted a consumer repo's own
`.loom/hooks/post-worktree.sh` during a routine version upgrade (issue #5971).
Nothing in `.loom/hooks/` is even eligible to appear in `installed_files` —
hook scripts are deliberately excluded from the install manifest (#4262) — so
"absent from the manifest" can never mean "not yours" for that directory.
