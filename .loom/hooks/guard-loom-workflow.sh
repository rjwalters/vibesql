# guard-loom-workflow.sh - PreToolUse hook for Loom-workflow-specific Bash guards
#
# Claude Code PreToolUse hook that intercepts Bash commands before execution.
# Receives JSON on stdin with tool_input.command and cwd fields.
#
# This hook carries the Loom-workflow-specific guards that were extracted from
# guard-destructive.sh (issue #3604), plus later Loom-specific additions:
#
#   1. LOOM: Prefer merge-pr.sh over 'gh pr merge'
#   2. LOOM: Block 'pip install -e' inside worktrees (issue #2495, #4079)
#   3. LOOM: Ask before real-registry-mutating `loom-daemon workspace
#      add|remove|set-priority` (issue #4326)
#
# The generic repository-hygiene guards (catastrophic denies, SQL/cloud toggles,
# ASK patterns) live in guard-destructive.sh and are being migrated toward Repo
# Skills (rjwalters/repo#13). This file stays Loom-owned because these guards
# are specific to the Loom worktree/merge/daemon workflow.
#
# IMPORTANT: This hook only fires when Claude Code is invoked with:
#   --dangerously-skip-permissions  ← hooks FIRE (used by Loom agents)
#
# It does NOT fire with:
#   --permission-mode bypassPermissions  ← hooks SKIPPED entirely
#
# Output format (Claude Code hooks spec):
#   { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..." } }
#
# NOTE: The "hookEventName": "PreToolUse" field is REQUIRED by Claude Code's
# PreToolUse hook schema. Without it, Claude Code silently discards the
# decision and the guard becomes inert (see issue #3550).
#
# Error handling: This script MUST never exit with a non-zero code or produce
# invalid output. Any internal error is caught by the trap, logged for
# diagnostics, and results in an "allow" decision to prevent infinite retry
# loops in Claude Code.

# GH-PR-MERGE-REDIRECT FALSE-POSITIVE MASKING (issue #5109)
#
# The 'gh pr merge' redirect check below (guard tag loom:gh-pr-merge-redirect)
# used to grep the RAW, unmasked $COMMAND for the literal substring "gh pr
# merge" anywhere in the byte stream -- so it fired on commands that never
# actually invoked the disallowed CLI, only mentioned the phrase as inert
# text: a git commit message (passed via the CLAUDE.md-documented `-m
# "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` heredoc idiom) that quoted the phrase as prose
# documenting the very rule this guard enforces, and a `gh issue list
# --search "..."` query whose search string happened to contain the phrase
# as text to search FOR, not a command to run.
#
# The two functions below build a MASKED copy of $COMMAND, used ONLY for the
# 'gh pr merge' substring check immediately below -- never for any other
# guard in this file, and never for decision-log redaction (that stays on
# strip_literal_text() above, unchanged). Composition matters: heredoc-body
# masking runs FIRST so any quote/backtick characters living inside a masked
# heredoc body can no longer interfere with the flag-value masking pass that
# runs second.
#
# Deliberately narrow, matching this repo's established masking conventions
# (see guard-destructive-generic.sh's mask_heredoc_bodies(), #5000/#5087):
# only two specific, well-understood-safe shapes are masked, and a command
# that merely EXECUTES the disallowed CLI through a wrapper -- `sh -c "gh pr
# merge 123"`, `bash -c 'gh pr merge 123'`, `eval "gh pr merge 123"` -- is
# UNCHANGED by either pass (neither `-c` nor `eval`'s argument is in the
# whitelist below) and still denies exactly as before. Masking only ever
# narrows what this ONE check can see; it never widens what it misses.
# =============================================================================

# Mask the BODY of a heredoc whose consuming command is either of two
# provably-inert forms:
#
#   1. `cat`, whose delimiter is quoted (`cat <<'EOF' ... EOF` /
#      `cat <<"EOF" ... EOF`, and the `<<-` tab-stripping variant), AND whose
#      `cat` invocation is captured by a command substitution ($()/backtick)
#      that is the value of a known non-executing text-data flag. This is
#      exactly the CLAUDE.md-documented idiom for multi-line commit/PR-body
#      text: `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`.
#   2. `git commit -F -` / `git commit --file=-` (issue #5328), whose
#      delimiter is likewise quoted AND which is PROVABLY the command that
#      consumes the heredoc (see the "provable statement anchor" rules in the
#      function below, hardened twice by #5333). `git commit -F -`/`--file=-`
#      reads its commit message from stdin and NEVER re-emits it anywhere --
#      unlike `cat`, there is no `git commit -F - | bash`-style escape hatch,
#      so ONCE `git commit` is proven to be the consuming command it is itself
#      the confinement proof, and case 1's capture-into-a-flag check (`capre`)
#      is not needed. That proof is load-bearing: every known bypass of this
#      branch has been a way to make some OTHER command (an interpreter
#      reading the heredoc as live script) look like `git commit`.
#
# A QUOTED delimiter guarantees bash performs no $()/backtick/$VAR expansion
# within the body, so the body is 100% literal text in both cases; case 1's
# flag-capture requirement additionally guarantees that literal text is used
# as inert data (a message/title/search value) rather than executed -- a
# guarantee case 2 gets for free from `git commit` itself never executing or
# forwarding its stdin.
#
# Deliberately narrower than "any heredoc" on THREE axes:
#   1. A heredoc feeding an INTERPRETER (`bash <<'EOF' ... EOF`, `sh <<EOF`)
#      is genuinely live code, so masking is gated on the word/phrase
#      immediately before `<<` being `cat` OR `git commit -F -`/`--file=-`.
#   2. `cat` never executes its body, but its stdout can still be routed INTO
#      a shell on the same command line -- `cat <<'EOF' | bash`, or a captured
#      `eval "$(cat <<'EOF' ...)"`. Masking those would blind this
#      catastrophic-tier guard to a real invocation, so masking of a
#      cat-heredoc is ALSO gated on `cat` being captured into a text-data
#      flag's $()/backtick value (see the `capre` confinement check inside
#      the function). This second gate does NOT apply to the `git commit -F
#      -`/`--file=-` form -- `git commit` cannot route its stdin onward to a
#      shell the way `cat`'s stdout can.
#   3. The `git commit -F -`/`--file=-` form is instead gated on a PROVABLE
#      statement anchor (#5333): the opener's own text and every physical line
#      before it must be free of shell quoting/escaping, so the boundary that
#      makes `git commit` the consuming command cannot be faked. Details and
#      the enumerated attack shapes live on `commit_stdin_re` below.
#
# Mirrors the #5087 lesson: only a heredoc block that is PROVABLY CLOSED
# inside the buffer (its bare delimiter line is found) gets its body masked.
# An unterminated/unrecognized opener masks NOTHING and the raw text flows
# through unchanged to the check below.

        # mere positional parameters ($1..$4) -- in front of a `git commit -F -`
        # decoy. Three anchors were tried and two proved forgeable:
        #
        #   v1 `(^|[^A-Za-z0-9_])`   -- any non-word char: `bash -s -- git
        #      commit -F - <<'"'"'EOF'"'"'` matched on the plain SPACE. Forged.
        #   v2 `(^|[;&|(BT])`        -- a control operator or start-of-LINE. Still
        #      forgeable three ways: (a) `^` is start of a PHYSICAL line, but a
        #      backslash-newline continuation joins physical lines into ONE
        #      logical command, so `bash -s -- \<newline>git commit -F - <<...`
        #      matched at column 1 while bash saw one `bash -s` command; (b) an
        #      ESCAPED operator (`bash -s -- \; git commit -F - <<...`) is a
        #      literal `;` argument to bash, not a separator; (c) a QUOTED
        #      operator or quoted newline (`bash -s -- "x ; git commit -F -
        #      <<'"'"'EOF'"'"'` with the quote closing later) does the same.
        #      A fourth, unrelated to the anchor: the v1/v2 middle-token class
        #      `[^ \t]+` swallowed metacharacters, so `git commit -a;bash -s --
        #      -F - <<...` matched as if it were one git command.
        #   v3 (current) -- an operator/start-of-line anchor that is PROVEN
        #      unquoted and unescaped, by requiring the whole prefix to be
        #      shell-inert:
        #        * `commit_stdin_re` restricts the tokens between `commit` and
        #          `-F -`/`--file=-` to a metacharacter-free charset, closing (d).
        #        * `commit_pre_safe_re` requires EVERY character of the opener
        #          line before `<<` to come from a charset with no quote (SQ/DQ/
        #          backtick), no backslash and no expansion character, so any
        #          `;`/`&`/`|`/`(` matched by the anchor is necessarily a real
        #          control operator -- closing (b) and the same-line half of (c).
        #        * `prefix_inert[]` (computed in END) requires every physical
        #          line BEFORE the opener to be free of quotes, backslashes and
        #          heredoc openers, so the newline that `^` anchors to is a real
        #          command terminator: it cannot be a backslash-continuation
        #          (no backslash exists to continue with -- closing (a)), it
        #          cannot sit inside a multi-line quoted string (no quote is
        #          open -- closing the rest of (c)), and it cannot sit inside
        #          another heredoc'"'"'s body (no earlier `<<` -- which also rules
        #          out an outer UNQUOTED-delimiter heredoc, where `$(...)` in

# TWO-HOP HEREDOC-VARIABLE INDIRECTION MASKING (issue #5172)
#
# mask_cat_heredoc_bodies() above only recognizes a cat-heredoc captured
# DIRECTLY by a known text-data flag/field, e.g. `-m "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"`.
# It does NOT recognize the equally common two-STEP idiom of assigning that
# heredoc to a shell variable first, then referencing the variable later:
#
#   BODY="$(cat <<'EOF'
#   ...prose that quotes the disallowed phrase as a documented example...
#   EOF
#   )"
#   gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/N/comments" -f body="$BODY"
#
# Here the literal phrase text lives in the heredoc body at DEFINITION time;
# the LATER reference is only the variable name ($BODY), never the phrase
# itself. Raw substring scanning still catches the phrase living in the
# heredoc body, even though nothing in the command actually executes it — the
# false-positive class this function closes.
#
# mask_var_assigned_heredoc_bodies() masks such a heredoc's body at its point
# of DEFINITION, but ONLY when it can prove every LATER reference to that same
# variable -- in ANY bash form: $VAR, ${VAR}, or any parameter-expansion
# variant ${VAR:0:100} / ${VAR#pat} / ${VAR:-def} / ... (#5297) -- elsewhere in
# the command is itself confined to a known non-executing text-data flag/field
# value, AND that at least one such reference was actually observed. A variable
# with ZERO detectable references is never masked: it may be reached through an
# indirection this literal scan cannot see (`${!REF}`, `eval` of a computed
# name), so leaving the body unmasked (and thus scanned/denied) fails safe. The
# confinement allowlist is the same as
# mask_cat_heredoc_bodies/mask_data_flag_values (-m/--message/--body/--notes/
# --title/--comment/--search, or `gh api -f <field>=`). If ANY later
# reference to the variable falls OUTSIDE that confined context -- `eval
# "$VAR"`, `bash -c "$VAR"`, the bare variable used as a command, or simply no
# recognizable safe usage -- the heredoc body is left COMPLETELY UNMASKED, so
# a genuine two-hop bypass (assign `gh pr merge 123` to a variable via
# heredoc, then `eval` it) still denies exactly as before. Masking only ever
# narrows what this ONE check misses; it never widens it -- same invariant as
# every other masking function in this file.
#
# A variable reference that falls INSIDE a candidate heredoc's OWN body (the
# variable mentioning its own name as prose, e.g. describing this very fix) is
# excluded from the confinement scan -- it is inert text, not a later live
# reference -- by blanking every candidate's body span before scanning.

# to a real invocation. A command that WRAPS the phrase and then executes it

# this allowlist and stays fully visible to the merge-redirect grep below,
# exactly as before.
#
# `echo`/`printf` are different from the other allowlisted commands: their
# own quoted text CAN become a real execution vector, when piped into an
# interpreter (`echo "gh pr merge 123" | bash`) or produced by a command
# substitution consumed by one (`eval "$(echo ...)"`). So, unlike the other
# allowlisted commands, an echo/printf match is masked ONLY when BOTH hold:
#   1. The echo/printf invocation is not itself nested inside a `$(...)`/
#      backtick command substitution (a strong signal its output is about to
#      be consumed by something else, e.g. `eval`) -- decided from a
#      precomputed per-position nesting-depth map over the whole buffer, NOT
#      from the single character adjacent to the token, so `eval "$( echo
#      ... )"` and its newline-separated form cannot slip through (#6400).
#   2. The full run of quoted arguments is not immediately followed by a
#      pipe (`|`) into another command -- `echo "..." | bash` must stay
#      fully visible.
# grep/rg/check-duplicate.sh are unaffected by either restriction: they never
# execute a positional argument regardless of context, so they keep the
# original, simpler masking behavior.
#
# Masks EVERY quoted argument that directly, consecutively follows the
# command+flags (separated only by whitespace) -- not just the first -- so
# multi-positional-arg scripts like check-duplicate.sh's `TITLE DESCRIPTION`
# signature get both arguments masked. Masking stops at the first token that
# is not a quoted string (a bare filename, `&&`, `|`, etc.), leaving anything
# after that boundary -- including a real `gh pr merge` invocation chained
# onto the same line -- fully visible.

    # Per-position command-substitution nesting depth, computed with an
    # explicit OPENER-TYPE-AWARE STACK rather than a scalar counter: `$(`
    # pushes a SUB level, a bare `(` pushes a GROUP level, and a `)` pops
    # whichever level is on top -- decrementing the substitution depth only
    # when the level it popped was a SUB. A scalar counter (the first cut of
    # the #6400 fix) let ANY `)` decrement it, so a bare parenthesized
    # subshell used as an earlier sibling statement inside a still-open
    # `$(...)` silently un-nested everything after it:
    #     eval "$( (true); echo "gh pr merge 123" )"
    # the `)` of `(true)` closed the counter, the later echo read as
    # not-nested, its argument was masked, and this ASK-tier guard ALLOWED a
    # command that really does eval a live `gh pr merge` (#6400 re-review).
    # The same conflation broke `$(( ... ))` arithmetic siblings.
    #
    # `respect_q` selects the lexing interpretation:
    #   0 -- quote-blind: every `(`, `)`, `$(` and backtick counts wherever it
    #        appears. Cannot be desynchronised by an unpaired quote character
    #        (an apostrophe inside a `#` comment line, say), but a `)` that
    #        merely sits inside a quoted string can pop a real level.
    #   1 -- quote-aware: single quotes are literal, double quotes suppress
    #        bare `(`/`)` (which are not syntax there), and `$(` re-lexes its
    #        body with a fresh quote state that is restored when its own `)`
    #        pops -- so `"$(foo)"` and `$( echo "a)b"; ... )` both track
    #        correctly.
    # Neither interpretation is sound on its own, so the caller takes the MAX
    # of the two maps. Over-reporting depth only ever WITHHOLDS masking, which
    # keeps the flagged phrase visible and denies -- the fail-safe direction;
    # under-reporting is what produces a silent bypass.
    #
    # `case ... esac` gets its own tracking because a case PATTERN terminator
    # (`x)`) is the one common shell construct that writes a `)` with no
    # opener at all, so it would otherwise pop a level it never opened:
    #     eval "$( case x in x) :;; esac; echo "gh pr merge 123" )"
    # While a `case` is open on the current stack frame a `)` is treated as a
    # pattern terminator and pops nothing. Detection requires the literal word
    # `case` at a command position (start of buffer, or after a newline, `;`,
    # `&`, `|`, `(`, backtick or `{`), which keeps ordinary text such as
    # `X=$(grep case /etc/hosts)` from tripping it -- and a false positive
    # there would only WITHHOLD a pop, i.e. over-report, which is again the
    # fail-safe direction.
    #
    # Two further constructs write a `)` with no matching opener, closed by
    # #6408 in the same fail-safe (pop-withholding) style as `case`/`esac`:
    #
    #   * A `)` inside a `${...}` PARAMETER EXPANSION, e.g.
    #         eval "$( x=${y//)/}; echo "gh pr merge 1" )"
    #     `${...}` gets its own per-frame counter (`braceexp[psp]`, exactly
    #     mirroring `casecnt[psp]`): `${` increments it, a `}` decrements it
    #     while it is positive, and a `)` arriving while it is non-zero pops
    #     nothing. Per FRAME, not global, so a real command substitution inside
    #     the expansion (`${a:-$(date)}`) still opens and closes normally --
    #     its `$(` pushes a fresh frame whose own counter starts at zero.
    #
    #   * A `)` inside a HERE-DOCUMENT BODY that the earlier
    #     mask_cat_heredoc_bodies / mask_var_assigned_heredoc_bodies passes do
    #     not cover (a bare `cat <<E`, not captured into a text-data flag):
    #         eval "$( cat <<'"'"'E'"'"'
    #         )
    #         E
    #         echo "gh pr merge 1" )"
    #     On an unquoted `<<`/`<<-` the delimiter word is parsed (quoted or
    #     bare) and the body is located by scanning forward for its terminator
    #     line. Across that span a POP FLOOR (`popfloor`) is raised to the
    #     current stack pointer, so a `)` in the body can only pop levels the
    #     body itself opened -- never the enclosing `$(`. The body is still
    #     lexed normally otherwise: an unquoted-delimiter body IS expanded by
    #     bash, so a `$(` inside it is genuinely live and must keep raising
    #     depth. `<<<` (here-string) is explicitly not a heredoc opener, and an
    #     opener whose terminator line is absent from the buffer skips nothing
    #     at all -- so an arithmetic left-shift (`$((1<<2))`) misread as an
    #     opener cannot freeze the map.
    #
    # Both are monotone: they only ever WITHHOLD a pop, i.e. over-report depth,
    # which withholds masking and keeps the flagged phrase visible. That is the
    # same fail-safe direction as everything else in this function -- but it is
    # still a false positive if it reaches ordinary narration, so both are
    # bounded (per-frame counter, per-body floor) rather than global latches.

# ~/.loom/workspaces.json, but — like every other category guard in this
# file — a repo/session can opt out via the same

# cloud_guard_enabled(), …). This is INDEPENDENT of `LOOM_WORKSPACES_PATH`
# (the sanctioned scratch-registry seam that allows a specific mutating
# command through regardless of this toggle) — this toggle instead disables
# the ask machinery entirely, for an operator who finds it pure friction.
#

#      guards.workspaceRegistry (default true when absent)
