# /repo:sudo — Passwordless-sudo setup for dev machines

Install (or inspect, or remove) a `NOPASSWD:` **sudoers drop-in** for the
current user on **this machine**, so an agent driving the box over SSH isn't
stopped dead by a `sudo` password prompt it can't answer. A non-interactive SSH
session has no TTY to type a password into, so every root-level remediation —
`launchctl bootout`, killing a runaway root process, `spctl`, `renice` — stalls
until a human runs the command by hand. This command installs the standard fix
once, safely, so agent-driven remote sessions can finish end-to-end.

This is **machine-global, consequential setup**: the drop-in grants anyone
holding the user's SSH key effective root on this box. It is therefore in the
same **always-confirm-first** class as `/repo:remote`, `/repo:followups`, and
`/repo:update-tools` — it shows the **exact file contents** it will write and
**never applies silently**, even without `--ask`. There is nothing to opt into;
confirmation is the only mode. The reasonable trade this makes — passwordless
root for personal dev machines on a private tailnet — is a deliberate operator
choice, so the operator makes it explicitly every time a scope changes.

The **destructive-command guard still applies on top.** Passwordless sudo
removes the *password* gate, not the guard's `ask`/`block` gates on risky
commands (`rm -rf /`, force-push to `main`, cloud destruction, …). Granting
passwordless root does not weaken any of those checks.

## Usage

```
/repo:sudo                 # Guided: explain the grant, confirm, install an ALL-scoped drop-in
/repo:sudo --scoped        # Confirm, then install a command-list-scoped drop-in
                            #   (launchctl, pkill, spctl, renice, …) instead of ALL
/repo:sudo --status        # Report whether a drop-in exists, its scope, and validity — writes nothing
/repo:sudo --remove        # Confirm, then remove this command's drop-in file
```

## How it works

The drop-in lives at a well-known, per-user path — **the file itself is the
marker**:

```
/etc/sudoers.d/<user>-nopasswd
```

Both macOS and Linux read this directory automatically, so **no OS branching is
needed**:

- **macOS** — `/etc/sudoers` (a symlink target of `/private/etc/sudoers`)
  ships `@includedir /private/etc/sudoers.d` by default, and `/etc/sudoers.d`
  is `/private/etc/sudoers.d`.
- **Linux** — nearly every distro ships `#includedir /etc/sudoers.d` in
  `/etc/sudoers`.

The candidate file is always syntax-checked **in isolation** with
`sudo visudo -cf "$TMP"` *before* it is copied into `/etc/sudoers.d/` — a
malformed drop-in never becomes live policy. After the validated file is
installed, a full-chain `sudo visudo -c` (it validates `/etc/sudoers` **and**
every file it includes) implicitly proves the include chain is active on either
platform, so there is no need to detect the OS or hand-verify the directive.

The written file always carries a **discoverability header** on its first line
so `--status`, `--remove`, and any later host-posture audit (e.g.
`/repo:host-optimize`) can find and attribute it without guessing from the
filename:

```
# Installed by /repo:sudo (rjwalters/repo) — see .claude/commands/repo/sudo.md
```

Two scopes are supported:

- **ALL** (default) — blanket passwordless root:

  ```
  <user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
  ```

- **Scoped** (`--scoped`) — passwordless only for a small allowlist of
  service-management commands, so agents are unblocked on the operations that
  actually stall over SSH without granting blanket root:

  ```
  <user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/launchctl, /usr/bin/pkill, /usr/sbin/spctl, /usr/bin/renice
  ```

  Anything outside that list still prompts for a password. Adjust the allowlist
  to what the machine actually needs before confirming.

## Steps

### 1. Resolve the target and read current state

Resolve the drop-in path and read what's already installed — every mode below
starts here, and it is the whole of `--status`.

```bash
USER_NAME="$(id -un)"
DROPIN="/etc/sudoers.d/${USER_NAME}-nopasswd"

if [ -f "$DROPIN" ] || sudo test -f "$DROPIN" 2>/dev/null; then
  CURRENT="$(sudo cat "$DROPIN" 2>/dev/null)"        # readable only as root (0440)
else
  CURRENT=""
fi
```

Classify the installed scope from `$CURRENT`, ignoring the header/comment lines:

- **absent** — no file.
- **ALL** — the effective grant is `NOPASSWD: ALL`.
- **scoped** — the effective grant is a `NOPASSWD:` command list.

Determine the **requested** scope from the flags: `--scoped` → scoped list;
otherwise → ALL. (`--status` and `--remove` don't request a scope.)

### 2. `--status` — report only, write nothing

Report and **stop** — this mode never writes, never prompts, and must not
change the file's mtime:

- Whether `$DROPIN` exists, and its scope (ALL vs. the scoped command list).
- Whether it currently passes validation — run `sudo visudo -c` and report
  pass/fail (this reads the config; it does not modify it).
- Whether passwordless sudo is actually in effect right now:
  `sudo -n true 2>/dev/null && echo 'passwordless sudo works' || echo 'sudo still requires a password'`.

Then exit. Do not fall through to any write path.

### 3. `--remove` — delete this command's drop-in (confirm first)

Only ever remove **this command's own** file at `$DROPIN` (identified by the
header from step 1) — never touch other files in `/etc/sudoers.d/`.

1. If the file is absent, say so and stop (nothing to remove — idempotent).
2. Show the file that will be deleted and its current contents, and get an
   explicit **yes**.
3. Remove it, then re-validate so the removal didn't break anything:

   ```bash
   sudo rm -f "$DROPIN"
   sudo visudo -c
   ```

4. Confirm the effect: a subsequent `sudo` now prompts for a password again
   (`sudo -n true` should fail). Report done.

### 4. Idempotency check (install modes)

Before writing anything, compare the **installed** scope (step 1) against the
**requested** scope (step 2):

- **Same scope already installed** → **no-op.** Report "already configured
  (`<scope>`) at `$DROPIN`" and stop. Do not re-prompt and do not re-write —
  re-running with the same scope must make no changes.
- **Different scope installed** (e.g. `--scoped` requested but `ALL` is
  installed, or vice-versa) → this is a real change of the grant. Say so
  explicitly ("currently `ALL`; you asked for `scoped`"), and require
  confirmation in step 5 before overwriting.
- **Nothing installed** → proceed to step 5 as a fresh install.

### 5. Confirm, then write / validate / roll back

Always show the **exact file contents** (including the header line) that will be
written, name the target path, and get an explicit **yes** before touching
anything — even without `--ask`. Never write silently.

Build the file in a temp location and **validate the candidate in isolation
before it can go live** — only a syntactically valid file is ever copied into
`/etc/sudoers.d/`. There is no separate "enable" step for a sudoers.d file: the
`@includedir` / `#includedir` directive picks it up on the very next `sudo`
parse, so a broken file that reaches the directory is *already* live policy —
and because sudo fails closed on a syntax error, the rollback `sudo rm` could be
denied by the very file it is trying to remove. Validating `$TMP` first makes
that failure mode impossible; the post-install full-chain check is then only a
belt-and-suspenders proof that the include wiring is sound:

```bash
USER_NAME="$(id -un)"
DROPIN="/etc/sudoers.d/${USER_NAME}-nopasswd"
TMP="$(mktemp)"

# Header first (discoverability), then the grant line for the chosen scope:
{
  echo "# Installed by /repo:sudo (rjwalters/repo) — see .claude/commands/repo/sudo.md"
  # Default (ALL):
  echo "${USER_NAME} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
  # --scoped instead:
  # echo "${USER_NAME} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/launchctl, /usr/bin/pkill, /usr/sbin/spctl, /usr/bin/renice"
} > "$TMP"
chmod 440 "$TMP"

# Validate the candidate BEFORE it can affect live policy. visudo -cf checks a
# single file's syntax without installing it, so a malformed drop-in never
# becomes active and we never depend on a possibly-broken sudo to undo it.
if ! sudo visudo -cf "$TMP"; then
  rm -f "$TMP"
  echo "candidate sudoers failed validation — nothing installed" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Only a validated file reaches /etc/sudoers.d/:
sudo cp "$TMP" "$DROPIN"
sudo chmod 440 "$DROPIN"
rm -f "$TMP"

# Belt-and-suspenders: full-chain re-check proves the include wiring too. If it
# somehow fails, remove the drop-in and exit non-zero — never leave an
# unvalidated or broken file in place. (This rollback is now reliable because
# the file was already known-valid before it landed.)
if ! sudo visudo -c; then
  sudo rm -f "$DROPIN"
  echo "post-install validation failed — removed ${DROPIN}, no change made" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

The order is load-bearing: the candidate is syntax-checked with
`visudo -cf "$TMP"` **before** the `cp`, so a malformed drop-in never becomes
live policy and the rollback never has to fight a broken sudo. The post-install
`visudo -c` is the final full-chain gate; if it fails for **any** reason the
drop-in is deleted and the command exits non-zero — there is no path in which a
failed-validation file survives, and no path in which an unvalidated file goes
live even momentarily.

### 6. Verify and report

On success, prove the grant actually took and report a compact block:

```bash
sudo -n true 2>/dev/null && echo 'passwordless sudo now works' \
                         || echo 'WARNING: drop-in written and validated but sudo -n still prompts'
```

Report: the path written, the scope (ALL vs. the scoped list, with the exact
command list for the scoped case), that permissions are `0440`, that
`visudo -c` passed, and the removal command (`/repo:sudo --remove`) for undoing
it later.

## Safety Rules

1. **Always confirm before writing** — show the exact file contents (header +
   grant line) and the target path, and act only on an explicit yes. There is
   no silent/auto-apply mode; confirmation is the only mode.
2. **Validate the candidate before it goes live, then roll back on failure** —
   the candidate is built at `0440` in a temp file and syntax-checked in
   isolation with `sudo visudo -cf "$TMP"` **before** it is copied into
   `/etc/sudoers.d/`, so a malformed drop-in never becomes active policy (a
   sudoers.d file is live the instant it lands, and sudo fails closed on a
   syntax error — validating pre-install is what keeps the rollback reliable). A
   post-install full-chain `sudo visudo -c` then re-checks the include wiring;
   on any failure the file is removed and the command exits non-zero. A broken
   sudoers file can lock the user out of root, so an unvalidated file is never
   installed or left behind.
3. **Idempotent** — re-running with the same scope detects the existing drop-in
   and no-ops; only a scope *change* prompts to overwrite.
4. **Only ever touch this command's own drop-in** at
   `/etc/sudoers.d/<user>-nopasswd` (identified by its `Installed by /repo:sudo`
   header) — never other files in `/etc/sudoers.d/`.
5. **The destructive-command guard still applies** — passwordless sudo removes
   the password gate, not the guard's `ask`/`block` gates on risky commands.
6. **Prefer the smallest grant that unblocks the work** — offer `--scoped`
   (launchctl / pkill / spctl / renice) when blanket `ALL` root isn't needed.
